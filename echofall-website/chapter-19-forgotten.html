                <h1>Chapter 19 - Forgotten</h1><h3>I. The Walk Through the Womb of Error</h3><p>Haoyu was finally asleep, and back in dreamland.</p><p><p>He simply was; standing still, as if he’d been there for hours already.</p><p><p>Before him loomed the infamous Ossari Pyramid; the one he had studied through filtered sensor feeds and rover cameras in the sterile labs of UN-DSDA.</p><p><p>Now it towered above him.</p><p><p>It was taller than he imagined. Wider. And far more <em>intimate</em> in its horror.</p><p><p>Haoyu took a step forward.</p><p><p>The terrain beneath his boots yielded with a soft squelch, the topsoil like dried gelatin over wet sponge.</p><p><p>The silence of the forgotten world was oppressive.</p><p><p>He wandered, tracing the base of the pyramid. Here he found the Spine-Lanterns, collapsed like broken chandeliers, their ribs burst open, glowing cores fossilized to a faint iridescence.</p><p><p>He passed what he thought was a tree; until he realized it was a fused bundle of reversed-root Lurch-Buds, their root-children calcified mid-birth. Their outer tissue looked like bark, but inside the petrified plants were <em>faces</em>, sealed shut in fetal agony.</p><p><p>He turned and saw more:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Tongue Tracks in the ground; paths made by creatures dragging themselves across the dirt with muscular taste buds.</li>
<li>An overturned transport vehicle, unmistakably made from biological material; spinal column frame, limb-wheels, hardened skin stretched taut across the hood.</li>
<li>A wall made of Ossari skulls, every one cracked open like eggshells, brain-puddles long since dried into brittle crystal veins.</li>
</ul><p>Haoyu walked on, wordless.</p><p><p>It wasn’t just the <em>wrongness</em> of it all that sat in his chest.</p><p><p>It was the sadness.</p><p><p>The tragedy of it.</p><p><p>Every species that lived here; every <em>thing;</em> had tried. It had suffered. It had adapted in desperation, deformed itself into failure, mistake after mistake, and still, <em>it tried</em>.</p><p><p>He knelt beside what had once been a Slop nesting dome; vomit-layered walls hardened into a shell of chemical bile. Inside, fossilized offspring like jellied marbles sat fused together in a pile of frozen filth. Their eyes had no lids. Just exposed globs, pointed <em>inward</em>.</p><p><p>Haoyu shivered.</p><p><p>“Even in death… they never found peace,” he murmured aloud.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2019%20-%20Forgotten/480984217_122228753672031351_2201485459986581057_n.jpg" alt="480984217_122228753672031351_2201485459986581057_n.jpg" class="content-image"><p><h3>II. Liminal Spaces</h3><p>Above him, the sky was the same permanent gray it always had been.</p><p><p>No clouds. No moon. Just the faint brownish orange glow of a dying sun trying to burn through the upper ammonia layers.</p><p><p>He looked up at that sun.</p><p><p>And a second sorrow struck him; this place is utterly, completely forgotten.</p><p><p>Back on Earth, the control center that once monitored this landscape had been dismantled.</p><p><p>The relay drones were now offline, floating useless hunks of titanium and electronics through the endless vacuum of space.</p><p><p>The rover that had once stood in this very valley was probably still pointing at some incomprehensible structure.</p><p><p>Nhexus had been buried by time, bureaucracy, and shame.</p><p><p>A miracle of cosmological rarity; <em>the single worst biological mistake in the known universe…</em> and humanity had decided it wasn’t worth the embarrassment.</p><p><p>They had unplugged it, labelled it as fake, ignored it, neglected it.</p><p><p>Forgotten it.</p><p><p>Moved on.</p><p><p>Haoyu placed his hand upon a fossilized flesh wall.</p><p><p>And in that moment, he mourned it.</p><p><p>Because it had suffered…</p><p><p>…and no one came to say goodbye.</p><p><p>Haoyu had lost track of time; if time even existed here.</p><p><p>He had walked for what felt like hours, maybe days, through the urban sprawl behind the pyramid.</p><p><p>This wasn’t visible to the rover; no one back on Earth had seen this.</p><p><p>The rover had only scanned the outskirts, only glimpsed the valley’s edge.</p><p><p>But here, in this forgotten corridor of the Slop planet, there were cities.</p><p><p>Flesh-built skyscrapers, rising like tumors of bone and tendon, webbed together with fossilized sinew and cartilage, there were bridges on the 5th, 6th and 7th floors connecting the skyscrapers - the bridges looked like one of those ant bridges you see in jungles in documentaries.</p><p><p>Each building different; one narrow and twisting like a severed intestine spire, another wide and hunched like a corpse trying to stand.</p><p><p>The "windows" were made of skin stretched out so thin that you could sort of see through them.</p><p><p>The balconies? Rows of ossified fingers or massive rib cages.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2019%20-%20Forgotten/481217559_122228753750031351_2515079089565637785_n.jpg" alt="481217559_122228753750031351_2515079089565637785_n.jpg" class="content-image"><p>Haoyu passed one tower that had grown into itself; its top bent backward, re-absorbing the base through a collapsed archway of ribs.</p><p><p>The roads were made of spine segments, vertebrae aligned perfectly like bricks, polished smooth by the ancient air.</p><p><p>And still, the deeper he went, the quieter it got.</p><p><p>Just the echoes of his footsteps.</p><p><p>And yet; couldn’t shake the feeling.</p><p><p>The endless liminal spaces. The sensation.</p><p><p>The one that creeps in when you’re <em>truly alone</em>, and know you’re alone…</p><p><p>But some primal shard of your brain insists:</p><p><p>You’re being watched.</p><p><p>The kind of feeling that isn’t fear, exactly; just a subtle tightening in the chest, a static behind the ears, a vague pressure in the air like someone’s gaze is pressing against the back of your neck.</p><p><p>But he wasn’t being watched.</p><p><p>There was no movement.</p><p><p>No figures in the windows.</p><p><p>No flickers behind the shadows.</p><p><p>It was just residual instinct.</p><p><p>A leftover response in a man raised in a world where silence rarely meant safety.</p><p><p>But here, on Nhexus</p><p><p>It was just silence.</p><p><p>True silence.</p><p><p>And it was unsettling.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2019%20-%20Forgotten/u8296664269_liminal_spaces_buildings_made_of_bone_vast_street_f11317b7-22d8-48da-9fb9-f737c9ccd4af_0.png" alt="u8296664269_liminal_spaces_buildings_made_of_bone_vast_street_f11317b7-22d8-48da-9fb9-f737c9ccd4af_0.png" class="content-image"><p>Eventually, he turned a corner; one massive, bloated building had blocked his view until he reached the end of the street.</p><p><p>And then he saw it.</p><p><p>He froze.</p><p><p>There it was.</p><p><p>The Chuckwagon Café.</p><p><p>Unchanged.</p><p><p>Exactly as it had been in his prior two dreams. The old wood exterior. The painted sign hanging by a crooked nail. The cracked neon “OPEN” light buzzing faintly, despite having no power source.</p><p><p><ul>
<li>A chalkboard leaned on its side, the words <em>“$10 baby back ribs!”</em> faintly visible under the haze of the ancient sun.</li>
</ul><p>And standing at the front door; boots up on the railing, straw hat tipped low over his eyes was Dallas Red.</p><p><p>He looked up as if he’d been expecting him for hours.</p><p><p>Gave a small nod.</p><p><p>Then, with a wry grin, said:</p><p><p>“You comin’ in for a drink, cowboy?”</p><p><p>Haoyu didn’t answer at first.</p><p><p>His mind was still processing the impossibility of it all.</p><p><p>This building.</p><p><p>On this planet.</p><p><p>Surrounded by structures built from failure and agony…</p><p><p>And here was Dallas, like nothing was wrong.</p><p><p>Like the whole damn thing made sense.</p><p><p>Haoyu took one step forward.</p><p><p>Then he nodded slowly.</p><p><p>“Yeah… I think I’ll order an Old Fashioned.”</p><p><p>He stepped forward toward the warped saloon door, each step crunching softly across the fossil-dust underfoot. Dallas, leaning lazily against the doorframe with his usual calm, gave a knowing nod and said:</p><p><p>“You go first, so I don’t somehow lose you like I did last time.”</p><p><p>It was a strange thing to say, but Haoyu found comfort in it.</p><p><p>Because last time; on that glimmering crystalline plain; when Dallas went into the saloon… Dallas just disappeared, and the inside of the cafe was scary… and unsettling.</p><p><p>But this time, with that cowboy drawl still fresh in the air, he felt a thread of assurance that maybe… maybe he wouldn’t be alone in this next dream-space.</p><p><p>He reached for the handle.</p><p><p>Turned it.</p><p><p>Opened the door.</p><p><p><h3>III. You Gotta Try The Rib Special!</h3><p>The instant the saloon opened before him, the comfort evaporated. A wave of wet rot slapped him in the face; thick, mucosal, reeking of spoiled organs and something worse.</p><p><p>It wasn’t the Chuckwagon Café anymore. Not even close.</p><p><p>It was Nhexus.</p><p><p>Alive.</p><p><p>The floor had collapsed into a muck-swamp basin, churning with viscous sludge. The liquid surface convulsed with the movement of half-born things; blubbery, translucent growths twitching and pulsing as if trying to scream through unformed mouths.</p><p><p>Fused into the interior saloon walls were flesh-twisted creatures; no longer dead, no longer fossilized. Their bodies had become part of the architecture itself. One had dozens of arms, all sprouting from a swollen torso, reaching and grasping for nothing. Another had teeth along its spine, grinding against the timber support beam as if chewing through its own back.</p><p><p>From the ceiling, a pale creature hung upside down, tethered by intestines, its face <em>peeling</em>, mouth opening and closing in slow, broken sobs. Its eyes were misplaced; some inside its cheeks, others sealed shut with skin grown over them.</p><p><p>The air was alive with sounds:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Gurgles.</li>
<li>Wet gasps.</li>
<li>Screeching moans.</li>
<li>High-pitched whimpers.</li>
</ul><p>And then, at the far end of what used to be the bar, stood a massive beast… this beast was somehow different from everything else on Nhexus. It was unique. An anomaly.</p><p><p>A mutated pig-thing, nearly seven feet tall at the shoulder, its hide patchy with leaking sores, its lower jaw hanging like melted rubber, twitching with malformed fangs. One eye stared, too large, too wet, too human. The other socket had no eye at all, just a raw hole pulsing with red meat and twitching nerves.</p><p><p>It was looking straight at Haoyu… Haoyu felt an overwhelming evil presence pulsating from the entity.</p><p><p>A moment passed.</p><p><p>And Haoyu finally turned to check behind him; looking for Dallas, for the door, for any glimpse of comfort.</p><p><p>But Dallas was gone.</p><p><p>So was the saloon door, and the saloon was also gone from the fever dream.</p><p><p>Suddenly he stood right at the rovers initial landing site - at the foot of the monolithic pyramid, alive and looming. Its surface wasn’t stone anymore; it was raw, fleshy, pulsating with slow contractions, like a sleeping heart that had never stopped beating. From its base oozed a thick black syrup that hissed when it touched the ground, giving off a stench like burnt fat and grave mold. Sounds of painful wailing and agony screams howled away by the tens of thousands.</p><p><p>Then, the ground liquefied beneath his feet.</p><p><p>Spongey terrain gave way to sludge, creeping up his boots. It sucked at his ankles. It was warm. It moved on its own.</p><p><p>From within it rose insects; but not like any he’d ever seen.</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Translucent with hollow abdomens filled with writhing black threads.</li>
<li>Backs lined with molar-like teeth, chewing silently.</li>
<li>Mouths in their legs, gnawing at his pants.</li>
<li>Some had tiny human fingers where antennae should be.</li>
</ul><p>They began crawling up his legs in waves; hundreds of them, biting, grasping, tasting.</p><p><p>Haoyu opened his mouth to scream.</p><p><p>And he woke up.</p><p><p>Bolted upright in bed, gasping, soaked in sweat, heartbeat hammering like a deathmetal bass drum in his chest.</p><p><p>The air was still.</p><p><p>His breathing ragged.</p><p><p>That nightmare had felt more real than anything in the waking world.</p><p><p>Because the world he saw; the Slop Planet alive; wasn't a vision of a myth or a dream.</p><p><p>It was a memory.</p><p><p>Something had happened there.</p><p><p>And now it was in his mind.</p><p><p>For a moment, he forgot where he was.</p><p><p>The hotel room was unfamiliar; clean, bland, beige with sterile framed prints of prairies and pine trees. It took a beat before he remembered: Calgary.</p><p><p>He checked the clock.</p><p><p>1:04 PM.</p><p><p>“Shit.”</p><p><p>His flight had landed the day before, after a terse customs check and one last signature at the parole office. He'd checked into the hotel late, eyes still red from five straight nights of courtroom stress and sleep-deprived fever dreams.</p><p><p>But today wasn’t a day for hesitating.</p><p><p>This was the day.</p><p><p>The seventh day.</p><p><p>The day from the dream.</p><p><p>Meetup at 4:00 PM.</p><p><p>He had three hours.</p><p><p>He moved fast.</p><p><p>Threw on his shirt. Slipped into a blazer. Shaved just enough to not look homeless. Splash of cold water. A protein bar in his mouth. No time for real food.</p><p><p>The hallway was quiet. Elevator ride silent.</p><p><p>He ran down the block to a car rental enterprise, filled out the paperwork, paid. The clerk didn’t look twice at his ID, guess they weren’t watching the news.</p><p><p>Over in the parking lot, the rental car; a scratched, year 2499 Honda Civic with cracked interior trim and a cheap pine tree air freshener swinging from the mirror.</p><p><p>“Good enough.”</p><p><p>The highway out of Calgary ran long and flat, cutting through yellowed prairie and distant foothills like a blade. The sky overhead was wide, too wide, smeared with thin clouds that looked like fingerprints on a windshield.</p><p><p>The Chuckwagon Café was about an hour south, out near Diamond Valley, a place he’d never even heard of until a dream told him it mattered.</p><p>
