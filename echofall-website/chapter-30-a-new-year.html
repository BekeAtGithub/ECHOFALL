Living with her 21 year old rich, famous, athlete boyfriend in St. Louis, Missouri</p><p><p>The basketball star mistreated her and joked to his entourage that she was “like some post-apocalypse fairy tale girl.”</p><p><p>She didn’t laugh.</p><p><p>They didn’t know she still had night terrors, or cared much about her past trauma.</p><p><p>Every time she hears loud bangs or thuds - the feint echo of the police raid flash banging the house - and the memories of the past pour in - so she puts up trauma walls, intentionally avoiding loud activities.</p><p><p>Their mother, alone in Albany, New York, wore the same cardigan she’d worn for the past three winters.</p><p><p>She stirred gray porridge on an old stove, the only light coming from three tiny picture frames hanging crooked above her table.</p><p><p>One for Haoyu.</p><p><p>One for her son.</p><p><p>One for her daughter.</p><p><p>She hadn’t spoken to either of them in over a year.</p><p><p>She whispered “Happy New Year” to the photos, and sobbed in tears for the rest of the night.</p><p><p>Dmitry, still in Seattle, mopped up spilled bio-ink from the factory floor.</p><p><p>The supervisor didn’t even nod at him as he passed.</p><p><p>At midnight, the pipes above groaned.</p><p><p>Steam hissed.</p><p><p>Dmitry looked up from his mop, exhaled a long breath, and whispered something in Sylver tongue; a phrase he barely remembered.</p><p><p>Then went back to mopping.</p><p><p>Steven Young sat on the beach in Tampa, surrounded by laughter and music.</p><p><p>He held a bottle of cheap beer. Unopened.</p><p><p>Bonfires lit the sand. Fireworks boomed over the ocean.</p><p><p>He didn’t blink when one exploded too low and startled a kid nearby.</p><p><p>He just kept staring forward; dead-eyed, numb.</p><p><p>A girl flirted with him. He didn’t hear her.</p><p><p>He only heard the bangs of the fireworks, remembering:</p><p><p>“POLICE! OPEN UP!”</p><p><p><strong>Calgary Maximum Prison</strong><p>Dallas Red sat motionless behind the same rusted bars.</p><p><p>He kept a drawing taped to his wall; a crayon sketch from one of the refugee children he saved way back during the pre-invasion chaos.</p><p><p>The kids drawing showed his ranch, the cows, and a stick-cowboy resembling Dallas under a smiling sun.</p><p><p>It was faded. Torn.</p><p><p>He stared at it for hours each night.</p><p><p>Sometimes, he smiled. But only a little.</p><p><p>The refugee families he’d once housed came and went.</p><p><p>They protested.</p><p><p>They shouted.</p><p><p>They marched.</p><p><p>But the world never heard them.</p><p><p>Their signs were banned.</p><p><p>Their videos scrubbed.</p><p><p>Their voices... censored by media… nobody outside from a few towns in Canada knew Dallas ever existed.</p><p><p>His name would fade into time of the coming decades.</p><p>
