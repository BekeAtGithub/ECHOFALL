                <h1>Chapter 18 - Laid to Rest</h1><h3>I. The Echofall Project - Neglected and Forgotten</h3><p><strong>The UN-DSDA Control Center, outside Fort Campbell TN</strong><p>The server room was quiet now.</p><p><p>No hum of processors.</p><p><p>No blinking lights.</p><p><p>No alert pings chirping in red across dim screens.</p><p><p>Just dust.</p><p><p>The Echofall control center; once the crown jewel of Earth’s deep-space observational infrastructure; was now abandoned. The desks had been cleared. The wall-sized projection displays unbolted and carted off. The chairs, tagged for auction, were stacked awkwardly in a corner behind crates of fiber cabling no one bothered to inventory.</p><p><p>Once, this room had broadcasted the impossible; images of an alien world, a planet of bones and towers made of flesh, the first whispers of proof that humanity was not alone. A whole team had lived in this room; slept in shifts, ate in the hallway, argued over readings, whispered theories behind cups of black coffee and cold dinner rolls.</p><p><p>Now?</p><p><p>Just emptiness.</p><p><p>Nhexus; the name barely meant anything to the interns now assigned to rewire the control center for general use. One of them, bored, asked an older engineer about it during a lunch break.</p><p><p>“Wasn’t that the Slop Planet thing?”</p><p><p>The engineer just shrugged.</p><p><p>“Old probe. Some kind of AI generated hoax. Whole thing got shut down. Don’t worry about it.”</p><p><p>The servers that once monitored the quantum entanglement compression feeds were dismantled.</p><p><p>The network relay drones; over a dozen of them; now floated aimlessly in deep space, offline, unpinged, no longer tracked.</p><p><p>And the EON-7b rover?</p><p><p>Still sitting there.</p><p><p>On a cracked, alien plateau.</p><p><p>Pointed toward a half-buried fossil of some grotesque structure no one remembered anymore.</p><p><p>The rover became just another fossil added to the collection of forgotten things on the dead planet.</p><p><p>In the corner of the darkened room, high on the wall, a faded whiteboard still bore the outline of the original project title in red marker:</p><p><p>ECHOFALL</p><p><p>No one erased it.</p><p><p>No one cared.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2018%20-%20Laid%20to%20Rest/controlroom.png" alt="controlroom.png" class="content-image"><p>For the commander… more legal arguments at the court, Haoyu and his lawyer trying to provide evidence which was all being wiped from datacenters as they speak.</p><p><p>The courts, media and press didn’t care about evidence. They just needed someone to blame for everything, and they’ll cover it all up if that’s what it took.</p><p><p>It became evident, Haoyu was facing a significant prison sentence. The public needed someone to be brought to justice.</p><p><p>Instead of politicians and corporate CEOs taking accountability- it was all blamed on the commander.</p><p><p>Haoyu had many more stressful, quiet, awkward interactions with his wife and kids, and had a hard time getting any sleep at night.</p><p>
