                <h1>Chapter 35 - Back in Action</h1><h3>I. Another Day at the Office</h3><p><strong>Seattle - 4:07 a.m.</strong><p>The city was silent except for the hum of flickering street lamps and the occasional siren in the distance.</p><p><p>Dmitry and Steven stood outside the shuttered entrance of a 24-hour discount store ; one of those ghetto-lit holes in the wall that sold off-brand toothpaste and knockoff batteries. With what little cash they scraped together ; grocery money, overdue rent ; they picked up:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Two cheap reusable backpacks (<em>if you could call a garbage bag a backpack</em>)</li>
<li>A flashlight</li>
<li>Gloves</li>
<li>Some canned beans and protein bars</li>
<li>A box cutter</li>
<li>Cheap socks</li>
<li>A couple $2 lighters</li>
<li>2 cheap blankets</li>
</ul><p>They didn’t have much. But they had <em>a mission</em>.</p><p><p><strong>Dmitry’s Apartment - 5:03 a.m.</strong><p>The apartment reeked of mildew, cheap incense, weed and cigarettes. The hallway was lined with stained carpet and cracked drywall. Apartment 303 ; Dmitry’s ; was more rust than door.</p><p><p>They slipped inside. Steven muttered under his breath.</p><p><p>“Looks nicer than my place.”</p><p><p>“At least you have a beach,” Dmitry replied, without humor.</p><p><p>The lights buzzed. A dying fridge growled in the corner.</p><p><p>Dmitry knelt under the sink, pulling out a toolkit caked with grease and dirt ; mostly car repair junk from a past life. He slid out a rusty crowbar, and an old greasy pipe wrench.</p><p><p>Then he paused. His voice dropped to a whisper.</p><p><p>“Next door. Lives an illegal narcotics trafficker, low time gangster. He waves a Glock around in the parking lot when he’s yelling at other thugs, we should go get it...”</p><p><p>Steven looked at him like he’d just offered to rob a church.</p><p><p>“You serious, man? We’re gonna knock off a damn drug lord at sunrise?”</p><p><p>Dmitry stared straight ahead.</p><p><p>“We have no car. No gun. No passports. No help. We just have the pig.”</p><p><p>“So yeah. I’m serious.”</p><p><p>He handed Steven the crowbar. Kept the pipe wrench for himself.</p><p><p>They both put on gloves.</p><p><p>“You sure he’s asleep?” Steven asked.</p><p><p>“I’m not sure about anything anymore.”</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2035%20-%20Back%20in%20Action/u8296664269_hotel_corridor_endless_perspective_dirty_brown_ca_c0d16ebc-f69b-440a-ac0b-73f22b0e3ae3_0.png" alt="u8296664269_hotel_corridor_endless_perspective_dirty_brown_ca_c0d16ebc-f69b-440a-ac0b-73f22b0e3ae3_0.png" class="content-image"><p><strong>Apartment 304 - 5:11 a.m.</strong><p>The door creaked open under the crowbar’s force.</p><p><p>Inside: hot, dark, and thick with the stench of chemicals, baking soda, drywall and burnt plastic.</p><p><p>The only sound was deep, <em>wet</em> snoring and a TV playing movies on maximum volume.</p><p><p>The man ; a local dealer with half a dozen priors ; lay unconscious on the sagging couch, one arm draped over a half-empty bottle of gin, the other lazily resting across a bong.</p><p><p>They moved like <strong>ghosts</strong>.</p><p><p>Dmitry crouched low, zeroing in on a duffel bag crumpled beside the couch. He unzipped it with surgical precision.</p><p><p><strong>Inside:</strong> bricks of cash - mostly dollar bills, baggies of powder, a balled-up hoodie soaked in something brown… and buried beneath it all:<p>A black semi-auto pistol. Two magazines. Full.</p><p><p>He passed the Glock and mags to Steven.</p><p><p>“You’re the redneck. You shoot.”</p><p><p>“Great,” Steven whispered. “All I wanted was pancakes this week, now I’m on the frontlines.”</p><p><p>They kept searching ; fast, silent, methodical. Steven headed into the kitchen, noticing a brick of crack-cocaine laying on a countertop scale. He cracked open the fridge, opened the jar of pickles, started munching as he raided for more food. Dmitry was in the bathroom, snatched a first-aid kit and a bottle of bleach. He peaked in a cabinet under the sink ; jackpot:</p><p><p>A homemade Mac-10, crudely welded from random steel sheets and pipes.</p><p><p>A dull, but wickedly serrated combat knife, taped to the back of the cabinet.</p><p><p>And a rusted metal toolkit, heavier than it looked.</p><p><p>Dmitry popped it open.</p><p><p>Ammo. Loose rounds. Stacked and rattling.</p><p><p>He grinned grimly, eyes gleaming with sudden purpose. He carefully began closing the kit, and he lifted it up, until…</p><p><p><strong>CLANG—CLACK—</strong><p>The handle snapped.</p><p><p>The box dropped.</p><p><p>And bullets exploded across the linoleum like metal hail.</p><p><p>Steven’s head jerked up.</p><p><p>“Oh fuck…”</p><p><p>Too late.</p><p><p>The drug dealer stirred, coughing himself awake, eyes blearily snapping open-</p><p><p>“HUH—HEY—WHAT THE FU—”</p><p><p><strong>CRACK.</strong><p>Steven didn’t hesitate.</p><p><p>The <strong>crowbar</strong> came down hard across the man’s temple.</p><p><p><strong>CRACK.</strong><p>Again.</p><p><p><strong>CRACK.</strong><p>A third time.</p><p><p>The dealer crumpled sideways off the couch like a sack of bones. Whether dead or unconscious didn’t matter. They had 30 seconds max.</p><p><p>“CYKA BLYAT!!” Dmitry barked, diving to scoop up handfuls of ammo, stuffing them into his already-ripping dollar store backpack, which now strained at every seam.</p><p><p>Steven grabbed the duffel bag, shoved some food inside, and followed him out the door-</p><p><p>No time to think. No time to clean. No time to breathe.</p><p><p><strong>Amtrak Yards - 6:04 a.m.</strong><p>They ran until their lungs burned.</p><p><p>The train was moving ; slow, groaning like a beast awakening ; crawling north out of the yard.</p><p><p><em></em>Destination: Canada.
Objective: The Artifact.
Deadline: Seven Days.<em></em><p>And the Pig was waiting.</p><p><p>Dmitry spotted a rear car with a maintenance ladder. Unlocked.</p><p><p>“You still got your climbing arms, cowboy?”</p><p><p>“Hell no,” Steven grunted. “But let’s roll.”</p><p><p>They hoisted themselves up, climbed inside.</p><p><p>Dark. Cold. But safe. For now.</p><p><p>The train clanked and jerked forward ; picking up speed.</p><p><p>“Time to cover up” said Dmitry, as they pulled the blankets out of their bags, a few bullets spilling out of the holes of Dmitrys backpack… He took out the medical tape from the first aid kit to patch up his bag, scrambling to fetch the bullets that fell out of the seams.</p><p><p>Then, the two of them hid, laid low between the crates being lugged to Canada, and covered themselves with their blankets. Beside some other sacks of goods, they blended in.</p><p><p><strong>Somewhere Outside Langley, British Columbia</strong><p><strong>8:57 a.m.</strong><p>The train hissed as it rolled to a crawl, the wheels squealing against a tight bend in the track. Outside the steel door, muffled voices drifted in:</p><p><p>“Langley yard’s backed up; tell dispatch we’re rerouting to Vancouver…”</p><p><p>“Yeah, we’ll offload two cars up the line. Should be clear in twenty.”</p><p><p>Steven and Dmitry crouched low in the storage car. The moment the workers’ footsteps faded into silence, the two men exchanged a look.</p><p><p>“We ain't tryna see no damn Vancouver,” Steven whispered.</p><p><p>Dmitry cracked the door open an inch.</p><p><p>Through the slit: sunlight. Trees. The outskirts of Langley, brush and uneven patches of dense bushland stretching beyond the tracks.</p><p><p>The train lurched forward again; slow, steady, not yet gaining speed.</p><p><p>“We should jump out into these bushes and trees.” Dmitry muttered.
”Fuck” said Steven.</p><p><p>They leapt.</p><p><p>Boots hit gravel.</p><p><p>Dirt kicked up.</p><p><p>And within seconds they were gone, swallowed by the undergrowth, ghosting into the green bush with bags slung and weapons hidden beneath oversized thrift-store jackets.</p><p><p><strong>Langley - 9:34 a.m.</strong><p>They’d made it.</p><p><p>In Canada.</p><p><p>With a duffel full of cash, dry goods, homemade explosives, and two illegally possessed firearms, one of which ; the Mac-10 ; would get them life in prison just for touching it.</p><p><p>They stuck to alleyways, fences, and powerline trails. The early hour and the fog of winter morning worked in their favor.</p><p><p>“We need wheels,” Dmitry said, eyes scanning the backstreets.</p><p><p>They found it in a cracked lot behind a shuttered vape shop: an old, dented electric sedan, paint peeling, one headlight duct-taped. A 26th-century beater, just begging to be stolen.</p><p><p>“You ever hotwire a self-start ignition AI lock?” Steven asked.</p><p><p>“No,” Dmitry said, pulling the crowbar from his bag.</p><p><p>“But I once reprogrammed a Martian orbital survey drone using a toaster and a credit card. So yes.”</p><p><p>He jammed the crowbar between the body of the car and doorframe. He pries open a gaping hole between them. Metal screamed. He shoved a hand through the gap and unlocked the door manually.</p><p><p>Inside, he cracked open the steering column, yanked out the embedded chip interface, and rigged together a loopback bypass using two wires, a pocket knife, and one of the 9mm bullets.</p><p><p>The dash lit up.</p><p><p>The car blinked.</p><p><p>It purred to life with a low whir.</p><p><p>“You stole us a car, Tech Wizard,” Steven said, climbing in.
”It’s not stolen, we are just borrowing it.” Justified Dmitry.
”Yeah, we’ll bring it back… for sure.” Steven agreed.</p><p><p><strong>Somewhere Eastbound, British Columbia Highway 1</strong><p><strong>10:12 a.m.</strong><p>The sun crept over the distant Cascade mountain range as the stolen vehicle tore through early-morning fog. Trees gave way to plains. Civilization thinned. The radio was off. The engine hummed.</p><p><p><strong>Destination</strong>: Swift Current, Saskatchewan.<p><strong>Distance:</strong> ~1,700 kilometers.<p><strong>Time:</strong> ~19 hours, nonstop.<p>They had food.</p><p><p>They had weapons.</p><p><p>They had cash.</p><p><p>And nothing left to lose.</p><p><p>“Echofall Project, final mission,” Steven muttered, peering at the road ahead.</p><p><p>“Find the guitar.</p><p><p>Finish the deal.</p><p><p>Save the Commander.”</p><p><p>Dmitry added… “and wipe out an entire alien civilization”</p><p><p>“all in a days work” followed up Steven</p><p>
