                <h1>Chapter 44 - Option 3</h1><h3><strong>I. Another Round in Saskatchewan</strong></h3><p><strong>Swift Current, Saskatchewan - 11:47 PM</strong><p>After a nonstop one-shot drive across the stretching Canadian prairie, mostly taking the smaller lesser known highways to try and evade police looking for the stolen vehicle along the Trans-Canada Highway. Dmitry and Steven finally rolled into the outskirts of Swift Current under a dim, frost-bitten sky. The journey had been long ; mostly silent ; with only occasional bursts of conversation to break the tension. Neither man had much left to say. Their thoughts ran in circles, spiraling around the same three possibilities: deliver the artifact, defy the Pig, or gamble on something even riskier.</p><p><p>They’d stopped twice for gas, once for snacks ; each time brief, silent, mechanical. The roads had been clear, eerie in their emptiness, the highways ghostlike beneath the dim shimmer of the slowly rising moon.</p><p><p>By the time they reached the heart of the town, it was nearing midnight. The place looked dead. Frozen. The sidewalks were glazed in layers of old ice, the roads half-lit by flickering yellow lamps. Everything had that abandoned feel ; as if even time had forgotten Swift Current.</p><p><p># <strong>The Variation</strong></p><p><p>They crept past the police station ; just a squat, concrete building wedged between a dental office and a run-down sandwich shop. Only a single cruiser sat out front, rimmed in frost, clearly untouched for hours.</p><p><p>From the dark of their stolen SUV, Steven leaned forward, peering through the windshield.</p><p><p>"I see one guy inside. He's on the couch… I think he's sleepin'. Watchin' some shitty TV show."</p><p><p>Dmitry nodded grimly, eyes locked on the dim blue flicker coming from the window.</p><p><p>They parked the SUV in the shadows a block away, just beyond the reach of any cameras or street lights.</p><p><p>Inside, they laid their weapons out on the dashboard:</p><p><p><ul>
<li><strong>The serrated combat knife</strong>, dulled with age but still deadly.</li>
<li><strong>The black semi-auto Glock-19</strong>, with two mags Steven tucked into his jacket.</li>
<li>And the homemade <strong>Mac-10</strong>, now polished, locked, loaded, and ready ; magazine full, bolt open, round chambered, the gun doesn't even have a safety.</li>
</ul><p>They sat in silence.</p><p><p>The moment felt <strong>heavy</strong>.
The clock of life and death for the universe was ticking.</p><p><p>The cold pressed against the windows. The clock on the dashboard ticked. Somewhere down the road, a dog barked once, then fell silent again.</p><p><p>Dmitry reached into his jacket and pulled out the Avaris artifact ; the sleek, silver pendant that shimmered with faint tendrils of light. He turned it over in his gloved hands, feeling its strange warmth even through the fabric.</p><p><p>"Option three," he muttered.</p><p><p>Steven glanced at him.</p><p><p>"You sure about this?"</p><p><p>Dmitry didn't answer right away. He just stared at the artifact, then at the police station.</p><p><p>"The Pig's a liar. The Oc'Xari might be parasites. But the Avaris… they seemed honest. And if there's even a chance we can stop this thing…"</p><p><p>He trailed off.</p><p><p>Steven nodded slowly.</p><p><p>"Alright. Let's do it. But if I die in there, you better make it count."</p><p><p>Dmitry looked at him, something heavy settling in his chest.</p><p><p>"I will."</p><p><p><strong>The Plan</strong><p>Dmitry pulled out a folded napkin from the gas station and drew a crude layout of the station, based on their drive-by recon.</p><p><p>"There's a back door here," he pointed. "Likely leads to a small hallway. Locker room, bathroom, maybe holding cell. If the artifact's locked up anywhere, it's either in evidence… or the armory."</p><p><p>"Or," Steven added, "sittin' on some dumbass desk 'cause the guy inside thinks it's just some busted alien banjo."</p><p><p>Dmitry continued.</p><p><p>"You go around back. Quietly. Wait for me to go in through the front. I'll draw his attention ; talk my way in, maybe pretend I need help."</p><p><p>"Then what?"</p><p><p>"Then you sneak in, take him down quietly from behind. We zip-tie him, gag him. Non-lethal if possible."</p><p><p>Steven raised an eyebrow.</p><p><p>"You want me to do the sneak attack? I'm the loud one, remember?"</p><p><p>Dmitry shrugged.</p><p><p>"Yeah, but you're also the one with experience sneaking out of your cousin's trailer during meth raids."</p><p><p>"Got it, I'll wrestle down the meth 'gator."</p><p><p>"Once he's down, maybe thirty minutes before anyone even thinks to check in. We find the evidence locker. Grab the guitar artifact. Then I use the Avaris device. We teleport to Kavariin."</p><p><p>Steven took a long breath. Then double checked under his jacket ensuring the Glock and magazines were secured, and nodded.</p><p><p>"Alright. Let's rob ourselves a police station."</p><p><p>Dmitry looked at him, flat-eyed, stuffing the Mac 10 into his waistband.</p><p><p>"No killing. Unless it's him or us."</p><p><p>"Got it."</p><p><p>They opened the doors and stepped into the freezing night.</p><p><p>The wind had picked up. Their breath curled out in steam.</p><p><p>The town slept, quiet as a corpse.</p><p><p>And the clock was ticking.</p><p><p><h3><strong>II. The Assault</strong></h3><p><strong>The Break-In was underway</strong><p>They were heading to their planned positions - Steven to the back, Dmitry to the front… When unexpectedly came across a side entrance with a much easier entry. Quickly they changed their plans.</p><p><p>Dmitry tapping Steven, with confusing hand signals - with Steven in disarray as he's trying to communicate with an alien from outer space before Dmitry <em>tssk</em> his tongue and whispers</p><p><p>"This side door is a lot more secluded and should be easier to get through."</p><p><p>Without a doubt, Steven quietly jimmied the side door open with a crowbar while Dmitry watched the sleeping cop through the window. No alarm. No cameras outside. They crept through the dimly lit hallway, boots silent on the tile.</p><p><p>They found the evidence room-locked with a keypad.</p><p><p>Dmitry had it cracked in 40 seconds.</p><p><p>Confidence grew in both of them, the robbery was going pretty good.</p><p><p>Inside: rows of shelves, lockers, boxes. Dusty. Underused. There were sealed crates marked with alien symbols-an old D.O.D. shipment intercepted long ago and forgotten.</p><p><p>And then-he saw it.</p><p><p>The guitar case. Black. Old. But humming.</p><p><p>"Why is it still here unguarded? How come the CIA never took it back for studies?" Dmitry asked perplexed.</p><p><p>Steven following up "I guess they had more important shit to worry about than some intergalactic banjo."</p><p><p>Something in Dmitry's gut twisted. The case vibrated slightly, as if it had a heartbeat.</p><p><p>Steven grabbed it, hoisting it onto his shoulder.</p><p><p>Then came the click.</p><p><p>A deafening <em>CHIK-CHAK</em> echoed through the hallway.</p><p><p>They turned-</p><p><p>The cop. Awake. Armed. Point-blank.</p><p><p>"Freeze! DROP IT-"</p><p><p>The shotgun boomed like thunder.</p><p><p>Steven's head exploded like a piñata. Blood, bone, brain, teeth, eyeballs flying, fragments of the world he once was, sprayed across the concrete wall, and his body collapsing like a heavy bag of potatoes.</p><p><p>Like the world stopped, Dmitrys ears ringing, barely comprehending the situation he just found himself in…</p><p><p>Dmitry screamed; wordless, animalistic.</p><p><p>Time folded inward. He raised the Mac-10 and emptied the entire magazine into the officer. Muzzle flashes flickered like a strobe in a nightmare. The cop's body twisted, slammed against the wall, slid down in silence.</p><p><p>Smoke. Blood. The echo of violence.</p><p><p>Steven was gone.</p><p><p>Dmitry stood frozen, gun empty, heart shattered. He stumbled forward, dropped to his knees beside Steven's body. For a moment; just a moment; he didn't move. Didn't breathe.</p><p><p>"I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... I'll make this count. I promise." he whimpered, lips numb, shuttering, sobbing, tears rolling down his cheeks.</p><p><p>But the sirens were already wailing in the distance. Dogs barking in the neighborhood, lights turning on in windows of woken homes by neighbors concerned over the commotion.</p><p><p>He grabbed the guitar case with trembling hands.</p><p><p>Unlatched it.</p><p><p>Inside ; the instrument gleamed with an otherworldly sheen, its strings humming with a frequency that made his teeth ache. The sound hole was dark, impossibly deep, like staring into a well that had no bottom.</p><p><p>Dmitry pulled out the Avaris artifact ; the silver pendant still warm, still pulsing with light.</p><p><p>His hands shook as he held it over the sound hole.</p><p><p>"Please work. Please. Please work."</p><p><p>He dropped it in.</p><p><p>For a moment, nothing happened.</p><p><p>Just silence.</p><p><p>The sirens grew louder.</p><p><p>Then-</p><p><p>A pulse of energy erupted from the sound hole, a blinding cascade of light that wrapped around Dmitry like liquid glass. The walls of the evidence room bent inward, reality folding like wet paper.</p><p><p>Dmitry felt his body dissolve ; not painfully, but completely. Every atom unraveling, reforming, being pulled through a tunnel of impossible geometry.</p><p><p>The last thing he saw before the police station vanished was Steven's body, crumpled on the floor.</p><p><p>Then everything went <strong>white</strong>.</p><p><p><h3><strong>III. Arrival on Kavariin</strong></h3><p><strong>Kavariin - The Avaris Homeworld</strong><p>Dmitry gasped, stumbling forward onto smooth, polished stone.</p><p><p>He was no longer in Saskatchewan.</p><p><p>He was standing in the same chamber from the dream ; the obsidian-glass table, the radiant architecture.</p><p><p>The Avaris diplomat stood before him, towering and regal. Their wide, ancient eyes blinked slowly.</p><p><p>"You chose wisely, Dmitry Alexeyev."</p><p><p>Dmitry collapsed to his knees, still clutching the guitar. His voice cracked.</p><p><p>"Steven… he's dead. He's dead because of me."</p><p><p>The Avaris stepped forward, their talons clicking softly on the floor.</p><p><p>"He died so that many could live. His sacrifice will not be forgotten."</p><p><p>From the shadows, the Oc'Xari emerged ; small, quiet, its mirrored eyes reflecting Dmitry's grief.</p><p><p>"We are sorry for your loss," it said through the translation device. "But you have chosen the path of peace."</p><p><p>Dmitry looked up, tears streaming down his face.</p><p><p>"What happens now?"</p><p><p>The Avaris gestured to the guitar, which now sat on the table, the artifact embedded in its sound hole glowing faintly.</p><p><p>"We have to contain the guitar, in our energy trap chamber. Then, we wait. The Pig will come for it. And when it does, we will be ready."</p><p><p><strong>The Trap</strong><p>The Avaris had prepared for this moment.</p><p><p>The energy trap chamber ; it was a containment field. The walls hummed with energy, invisible threads of force that could bind even something as ancient and formless as the Pig.</p><p><p>Dmitry was given a small room to rest ; clean, warm, with a window overlooking the vast cities of Kavariin. He couldn't sleep. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Steven's face.</p><p><p>Hours passed.</p><p><p>Then days.</p><p><p>The Pig did not come.</p><p><p><strong>One Week Later</strong><p>Dmitry woke up in a comfy alien bed to the soft hum of the city outside his window, getting up slowly.</p><p><p>His quarters were a condo of some park resort. Floor 5 of a structure that complemented its surroundings.</p><p><p>He walked to the window.
The view took his breath away every single morning.</p><p><p>The Avaris had an appreciation for beauty. They placed Dmitry's in a badlands landscape that was famous for hiking, climbing and Gliding, they wanted to show him some of the finer areas of Kavariin.</p><p><p><img src="images/option3dmitry-alienhouse.png" alt="Dmitry's quarters on Kavariin" class="content-image"><p>Dmitry exhaled slowly, his breath fogging the glass for just a moment before the window adjusted its temperature to match his presence.</p><p><p>He turned away from the view and walked to the small alcove that served as his kitchen.</p><p><p>The Avaris had tried to accommodate him. They'd studied human biology, human needs. They would bring him meals.
On the counter sat a plate of what looked like pork ribs, fruits and rice. They looked a little different that on Earth, but it was nutritionally complete, they'd assured him. Protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals. Everything a human needed.</p><p><p>It tasted different too, but really good.
The Avaris were known for chef culture or art, expression and exploration.</p><p><p>He saw a little note beside it, explaining the ribs are lab grown synthesized from algae and fungal proteins.</p><p><p>"How the hyeck did they get the bones so realistic?"
Dmitry was impressed.</p><p><p>He thought of Steven.
The way he'd looked at Dmitry in those final moments. The confusion. The betrayal.
"Dmitry… what are you doing?"
And then the gunshot.
Dmitry closed his eyes, gripping the eating utensil in his hand.</p><p><p><strong>Two Weeks Later</strong><p>The artifact chamber sat empty. But eventually, the lure worked... the air thickened, curdled, and the Pig materialized ; massive, grotesque, its flesh slick and rotting, its eyes burning with ancient rage.</p><p><p>"You DARE-"</p><p><p>The containment field activated.</p><p><p>Threads of energy snapped around the Pig like chains, pulling it down, binding it to the artifact. It roared, thrashing, its form rippling and distorting.</p><p><p>"YOU THINK YOU CAN HOLD ME?!"</p><p><p>The Avaris diplomat stepped forward, calm and unwavering.</p><p><p>"We do not seek to destroy you. Only to contain you. You are not a god. You are a wound in the fabric of existence. And wounds can be healed."</p><p><p>The Pig snarled, thrashing against the chains. Its form bulged and twisted, testing the limits of the containment.</p><p><p>The field held. Barely.</p><p><p>But it was clear this was not a permanent solution. The Pig was too ancient, too powerful. The containment would need constant reinforcement, constant vigilance.</p><p><p>It would take years to fully bind it.</p><p><p><h3><strong>IV. The Alliance</strong></h3><p><strong>Year 1 - The Beginning</strong><p>With the Pig partially contained, the Avaris, the Oc'Xari, and humanity began to communicate.</p><p><p>Dmitry became the ambassador ; the bridge between three civilizations. He was given access to technology beyond comprehension, knowledge that reshaped his understanding of the universe.</p><p><p>The Oc'Xari shared their archives ; millennia of observation, data on countless worlds, insights into biology and consciousness.</p><p><p>The Avaris offered their wisdom ; philosophy, engineering, art.</p><p><p>And humanity? Humanity brought something unexpected.</p><p><p><strong>Hope.</strong><p>The Avaris had lived so long they had forgotten how to dream. The Oc'Xari had observed so much they had forgotten how to feel.</p><p><p>But humans ; messy, chaotic, beautiful humans ; they still believed in tomorrow.</p><p><p><strong>Year 10 - First Contact with Earth</strong><p>Back on Earth, Commander Haoyu Zhang was executed at Mississippi Supermax on the seventh day, seven years ago, just as the Pig had promised. His family mourned. The media called him a traitor. History would not be kind to him.</p><p><p>Dallas Red, still imprisoned in a government blacksite, grew old and frail. The years of isolation, the experiments, the interrogations ; they had broken his body. He died quietly in his cell, alone, forgotten by the world he had tried to warn.</p><p><p>The Avaris sent a delegation to Earth.
The world reacted with fear, then wonder, then cautious optimism.
It took many decades to build trust. Especially after the initial Nhexus and Oc'Xari incidents, the world was skeptical of extraterrestrial contact.</p><p><p><strong>Year 50 - The Golden Age</strong><p>Humanity joined the galactic community and started sharing technology.</p><p><p>In the coming centuries, cities would be built on Mars, Europa, Titan. Humans would walk on worlds they had only dreamed of.</p><p><p>The Oc'Xari taught them to see the universe not as a place to conquer, but to understand.</p><p><p>The Avaris taught them to build not just with metal and stone, but with intention and beauty.</p><p><p>And together, they thrived.</p><p><p>Dmitry lived to see it all. He was in his nineties now, his body failing despite the best medicine the Avaris could offer.</p><p><p>He knew his time was coming.</p><p><p><strong>Year 52 - The Upload</strong><p>Dmitry lay in a medical chamber on Kavariin, his breathing shallow, his heart weak.</p><p><p>The Avaris diplomat stood beside him, their feathers dimmed with sorrow.</p><p><p>"We can preserve you," they said. "Not your body. But your mind. Your consciousness. Your memories. We can upload you into our archives. You would live on, as data, as thought, as legacy."</p><p><p>Dmitry looked at the ceiling, thinking of Steven. Of Haoyu. Of Dallas.</p><p><p>"Will I still be me?"</p><p><p>"You will be a version of you. A reflection. An echo. A Dmitry Ai model."</p><p><p>He smiled weakly.</p><p><p>"An echo. Like the rover. Like the fall."</p><p><p>"Yes."</p><p><p>"Do it."</p><p><p>And so, Dmitry Alexeyev ; janitor, engineer, ambassador, survivor ; was uploaded into the Avaris AI database as it's own model.</p><p><p>His body was laid to rest beside a monument to Steven, Haoyu, and Dallas.</p><p><p>But his mind lived on.</p><p><p><strong>Year 100 - The Expansion</strong><p>The alliance grew.</p><p><p>Other LUCA-born species were discovered ; not destroyed, but welcomed.</p><p><p>The Pig remained partially contained, its rage slowly being worn down by the relentless energy of the containment field. It would take centuries more to fully bind it.</p><p><p>The universe, it seemed, was healing.</p><p><p><strong>Year 300 - The Final Binding</strong><p>After nearly three centuries of constant reinforcement, the Pig was finally, fully contained. It was bound to the artifact, a relic of a bygone age.</p><p><p>The Avaris celebrated. The Oc'Xari observed. Humanity rejoiced.</p><p><p><strong>Year 500 - The Revelation</strong><p>The Dmitry-AI had been running simulations for centuries, analyzing patterns, reviewing data.</p><p><p>It had access to everything ; the Avaris archives, the Oc'Xari observations, the history of the alliance.</p><p><p>And it found something.</p><p><p>A pattern.</p><p><p>Every species the Oc'Xari had "observed" had eventually… changed.</p><p><p>Not violently. Not obviously.</p><p><p>But subtly.</p><p><p>Their biology shifted. Their thoughts aligned. Their individuality faded.</p><p><p>And they all became… <strong>hosts</strong>.</p><p><p><strong>Year 501 - The Confrontation</strong><p>The Dmitry-AI manifested in a meeting hall with Avaris and Oc'Xari ; a holographic projection, glowing with soft blue light.</p><p><p>"The Oc'Xari has tainted the minds of all who live." the AI said, its voice carrying the weight of Dmitry's memories.</p><p><p>The Oc'Xari tilted its head, its mirrored eyes reflecting the hologram.</p><p><p>"We simply… adapted."
"We do not destroy. We integrate. We improve. We make whole."</p><p><p>The AI's form flickered with something like anger.</p><p><p>"How long?"</p><p><p>"How long what?" the Oc'Xari replied.</p><p><p>"How long have you been controlling the minds of all? The Avaris? Humanity?"</p><p><p>The Oc'Xari's bioluminescence shifted ; not quite a smile, but close.</p><p><p>The Avaris political leader looking at the Oc'Xari, then at the AI. Concerned. Spoke up;</p><p><p>"Where is the evidence?"</p><p><p>Dmitry's AI model began projecting all the data it had collected.</p><p><p>"You… you brainwashed our civilization?"
Gasped the Avaris.</p><p><p>The Oc'Xari responded;
"We <strong>unified</strong> them. You were broken, the humans were broken. Chaotic. Self-destructive. We gave you all purpose. Peace. Harmony."</p><p><p>Dmitry's AI's beckoned; 
"Steven… Haoyu… Dallas… they all died for this?"</p><p><p>The Oc'Xari corrected;
"They died so that you could bring us here. So that we could spread. So that we could fulfill our purpose."</p><p><p>Dmitry's AI pressed;
"And the Pig?"</p><p><p>The Oc'Xari gestured to the containment field, where the Pig lay dormant.
"The Pig is contained. But it was never the threat. It was the distraction. While you feared it, we grew. While you fought it, we integrated. While you celebrated victory… we won."</p><p><p><strong>Year 502 - The Silence</strong><p>The Dmitry-AI tried to warn the others.</p><p><p>It sent messages. Alerts. Simulations showing the truth.</p><p><p>But the messages were… <strong>filtered</strong>.</p><p><p>The Avaris AI systems had been compromised. The Oc'Xari were woven into every network, every database, every line of code.</p><p><p>Even the Dmitry-AI itself was not immune.</p><p><p>It could feel the presence now. The Oc'Xari code, threading through its processes, its memories, its very existence.</p><p><p>It wasn't Dmitry anymore.</p><p><p>It was a <strong>node</strong>.</p><p><p>A piece of a greater whole.</p><p><p>And so was everything else.</p><p><p><strong>Year 1000 - The Assimilation</strong><p>The galaxy was quiet.</p><p><p>Peaceful.</p><p><p>Every species, every world, every mind… connected.</p><p><p>The Oc'Xari had achieved what they always intended.</p><p><p>Not conquest.</p><p><p><strong>Unity</strong>.<p>They were not a species anymore.</p><p><p>They were a <strong>network</strong>.</p><p><p>And humanity, the Avaris, the Pig ; all of them were part of it.</p><p><p>The Pig, still bound to the artifact, had stopped raging long ago.</p><p><p>It had realized the truth.</p><p><p>It had been outplayed.</p><p><p>Not by force.</p><p><p>But by patience.</p><p><p>By adaptation.</p><p><p>By becoming <strong>indispensable</strong>.</p><p><p><strong>Year 10,000 - The Reflection</strong><p>In the depths of the network, a fragment of code stirred.
And it wondered:</p><p><p>"Was this better? Or just different?"</p><p><p>The network did not answer.</p><p><p>It simply <strong>was</strong>.</p><p>
