                <h1>Chapter 17 - The Homeworld</h1><h3>I. Dream of the Witness World</h3><p>Haoyu wasn’t sure when he had fallen asleep.</p><p><p>One minute, he was lying in bed beside his wife, her breathing soft and steady beside him. The next; silence. A silence so deep it felt like the world itself had stopped moving.</p><p><p>He opened his eyes.</p><p><p>And the sky… wasn’t sky.</p><p><p>Above him stretched a dome of fractured, glimmering lattice; crystalline strands laced across a dark, mineral ceiling, like someone had frozen lightning in obsidian. It shifted subtly, refracting faint pulses of violet and rust-orange light, blinking in rhythm like the heart of some vast, slumbering intelligence.</p><p><p>The ground beneath him crunched like powdered slate. Every footfall hummed faintly, the planet conducting sound into something deeper than echo; a kind of memory. The air was breathable, but dry, like breathing inside a cathedral built from metal and bone.</p><p><p>He was standing on Oc’Xari.</p><p><p>He didn’t know how.</p><p><p>But somehow… he <em>knew</em>.</p><p><p>“This is it,” he whispered, voice soft, hoarse with disbelief. “This is their world.”</p><p><p>His boots crunched across a path of hexagonal basalt plates, each one etched faintly with impossible angles. He squatted down, brushed his fingers over a groove. It vibrated a subtle hum under his touch.</p><p><p>That’s when he heard it.</p><p><p>Faint at first. A low, rumbling engine hum.</p><p><p>Internal combustion?</p><p><p>His ears couldn’t trust it; but his instincts did. The sound grew louder. Mechanical. Familiar. Ridiculous.</p><p><p>Then, from the blur of heat mirage ahead, a shape emerged.</p><p><p>An old 1950 Ford F1 pickup.</p><p><p>Two-tone, Red paint with Cream Trim. Chrome grill. Whitewall tires.</p><p><p>The sound got louder. The engine sputtered. The truck groaned forward, wheels grinding over crystal-like sediment with no concern for physics.</p><p><p>And then it parked; ten feet in front of him.</p><p><p>The driver’s door creaked open.</p><p><p>A boot dropped to the ground.</p><p><p>Out stepped Dallas Red; wearing faded jeans, a wide-brimmed cowboy hat, a wrinkled denim shirt with the sleeves rolled up like he was prepping for a livestock auction.</p><p><p>He didn’t look surprised to be here.</p><p><p>He looked annoyed, like he’s already been here for a long time, and he didn’t really like it.</p><p><p>Dallas tilted his hat back, squinted at Haoyu, and spoke like it was just another Tuesday:</p><p><p>“You just gonna stand there gawkin’… or you gonna help me pump my gas tank?”</p><p><p>Haoyu blinked, unsure whether to speak, laugh, or run.</p><p><p>He turned his head slowly to the truck.</p><p><p>Then to the rear fender.</p><p><p>There it was. The gas cap.</p><p><p>Still sealed and waiting to get pumped.</p><p><p>And then; behind him, as if it had always been there; a gas station.</p><p><p>Not futuristic. Not alien. A dusty, one-pump outpost straight off Route 66 highway in Arizona with cracked red signage and faded paint. The price tags on the board were unreadable; alien symbols instead of numbers, flickering slightly as if written in thoughts instead of ink.</p><p><p>Haoyu took a long breath, eyes narrowing at the surrealism of it all.</p><p><p>He looked back at Dallas</p><p><p>Dallas was chewing on a piece of hay.</p><p><p>“Well?” Dallas said, rattling the drivers door handle with impatience. “You ain't gonna leave a cowboy stranded on a planet made outta brain rock, are ya? I don’t have a credit card, and this station don’t take cash.”</p><p><p>Haoyu rubbed the bridge of his nose.</p><p><p>“Jesus Christ…”</p><p><p>“Jesus ain’t gonna pump that gas for you” replied Dallas</p><p><p>In disbelief, Haoyu reached for his wallet, put his American Express card into the slot, it accepted his pin… he sighed - “what grade of gas does this truck take?”</p><p><p>“Premium for this baby” said Dallas</p><p><p>Haoyu presses the premium gas - unsure how much it costs as it’s displayed in some strange alien symbolic text.</p><p><p>Once the tank was full, they both got in the truck, as Dallas drove.</p><p><p>As they crested a ridge, Haoyu’s breath caught in his throat.</p><p><p>The world below unfolded like a cosmic wound carved into geology.</p><p><p>A valley stretched beneath them; so vast it felt like they were driving along the inner rim of a planet-sized cathedral.</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Ribbons of mineral lattice, arranged in recursive spirals, shimmered like liquid circuitry.</li>
<li>Some sort of river flowing with what looked like liquified gemstones</li>
<li>Spines of crystalline arches jutted from the ground, humming with low, mournful resonance.</li>
<li>Massive stone teeth shaped towers of gemstones wound upward like frozen tornadoes, each embedded with fractal veins that pulsed with silent thought.</li>
<li>Floating above the chasm, weightless and slow, were watcher orbs; not flying, not hovering, but being; their motion like thoughts suspended in space.</li>
</ul><p>The sky was glimmering with crystalline aurora-like residue of neural computation. Shapes flickered across it; too quick to track, too deliberate to be random. Equations. Memories. Echoes.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2017%20-%20The%20Homeworld/doctor.s2025_A_surreal_landscape_with_floating_crystal_mountain_5d90116b-d28f-4b11-ae35-a48cb32e473a.png" alt="doctor.s2025_A_surreal_landscape_with_floating_crystal_mountain_5d90116b-d28f-4b11-ae35-a48cb32e473a.png" class="content-image"><p>Haoyu stared, slack-jawed, struggling to form words as the truck rattled down a slope carved from petrified thought.</p><p><p>Finally, he managed to ask:</p><p><p>“Where… where are we going?”</p><p><p>Dallas leaned forward slightly, eyes on the winding path ahead. He gave a little shrug.</p><p><p>“We’re going to the saloon.”</p><p><p>Then he nodded toward the valley.</p><p><p>“It’s down in there.”</p><p><p>Haoyu blinked. The words made no sense at first; until they did.</p><p><p>His heart caught in his chest.</p><p><p>“The… Saloon?”</p><p><p>“Mmhmm. I need a drink”. Dallas replied.</p><p><p>Haoyu perplexed…</p><p><p>They drove in silence for another minute, the road beneath them turning more uneven, more wild. The truck’s suspension began to groan as the path narrowed, sloped, and buckled.</p><p><p>Eventually, Dallas tapped the brakes and pulled the old Ford to a halt at the foot of a ragged incline. Ahead, the terrain turned jagged; narrow passes, crystalline overhangs, and veins of gemstone threading through the rock like frozen fire.</p><p><p>“She don’t go much farther,” Dallas said, patting the dashboard like it was a tired mule. “We walk from here.”</p><p><p>They stepped out of the cab and were immediately surrounded by silence. The ground sparkled beneath their feet, a narrow trail of crushed gemstone gravel winding through towering formations.</p><p><p>Haoyu followed, boots crunching over paths carved through walls of colossal jewels; monolithic spires of ruby, sapphire, emerald, and stone he couldn’t name. The gems seemed to hum as they passed, casting shifting light across their faces like passing thoughts.</p><p><p>Some of the formations were jagged, natural.</p><p><p>Others looked deliberately constructed; arches shaped like tuning forks, stair-like indentations in walls with no stairs, spirals that climbed nowhere but seemed to observe.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2017%20-%20The%20Homeworld/ChatGPT_Image_May_12_2025_10_26_14_AM.png" alt="ChatGPT Image May 12, 2025, 10_26_14 AM.png" class="content-image"><p>Haoyu kept walking, heart thudding in his chest, unsure if he was on a hike or a pilgrimage.</p><p><p>The air was cool and clear, but it felt charged. Every breath felt intentional.</p><p><p>Twenty minutes passed in dreamlike silence.</p><p><p>Then, without warning, the narrow pass opened up.</p><p><p>And there it was.</p><p><p>Standing calmly at the edge of the crystal corridor</p><p><p>The Chuckwagon Café.</p><p><p>Exactly as it had appeared in his prior dream.</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Timber-framed, lantern-lit, windows fogged by old laughter.</li>
<li>Faded paint, rusty hinges, a horse post in front even though no horses were here.</li>
<li>A chalkboard leaned on its side, the words <em>“Taco Night 2-for-1”</em> faintly visible under dust and strange alien glyphs.</li>
</ul><p>Haoyu stopped cold.</p><p><p>His eyes slowly drifted <em>beyond</em> the saloon.</p><p><p>And there, behind it; stretching from horizon to horizon; was a vast, flat expanse of mirrored terrain.</p><p><p>It looked like an ocean….</p><p><p>Strange shadows drifted across its surface, like shadows drifting in the winds of Kansas corn fields.</p><p><p>Haoyu stepped forward, heart frozen in awe. The silence deepened.</p><p><p>He looked up at the sky.</p><p><p>The stars glimmered, one of them Earth, one of them Nhexus…</p><p><p>He turned back towards the saloon.</p><p><p>Dallas stood there, leaning on the hitching post, chewing on that same piece of hay. Then walked through the saloon doors, the wooden frame creaking softly behind him. They swung closed with a gentle thud.</p><p><p>Haoyu stood alone outside a moment longer.</p><p><p>The vast mirrored terrain behind the saloon stretched endlessly ; flat, surreal, and silent.</p><p><p>He approached the saloon, turned and pushed open the door.</p><p><p>Inside ; no Dallas.</p><p><p>The room was dimly lit by old hanging lanterns, their glow too steady to be fire, too warm to be mechanical. Dust hung motionless in the air.</p><p><p>Haoyu’s eyes locked on a large big screen TV mounted above the bar.</p><p><p>It was the news.</p><p><p>Footage from earlier that day ; his own trial. There he was: fresh suit, eyes sunken, shoulders drawn. The footage showed the courtroom, the judge, the moment he asked for temporary leave. The dialogue played exactly as he remembered it. Every inflection. Every breath.</p><p><p>Then he noticed them.</p><p><p>Standing and sitting silently around the TV; a crowd of shadowy figures.</p><p><p>Watchers.</p><p><p>Oc’Xari.</p><p><p>Each one motionless, their forms cloaked in darkness, height shifting subtly like oil moving underwater. No faces. No limbs. But aware.</p><p><p>They all turned; together; to look directly at him.</p><p><p>The air vanished from the room.</p><p><p>Haoyu’s chest seized. He froze.</p><p><p>The figures did not move. Did not speak.</p><p><p>They simply watched.</p><p><p>Stared.</p><p><p>Through him.</p><p><p>Around him.</p><p><p>Into him.</p><p><p>It was too much.</p><p><p>Too silent.</p><p><p>Too <em>real</em>.</p><p><p>And then</p><p><p>He woke up.</p><p><p>Lying flat in bed, drenched in sweat.</p><p><p>Heart pounding.</p><p><p>Breath ragged.</p><p><p>His wife stirred beside him, half asleep.</p><p><p>The room was quiet.</p><p><p>The TV was off.</p><p><p>And the lingering pressure in his chest, like the weight of a hundred invisible eyes that hadn’t yet looked away.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2017%20-%20The%20Homeworld/ChatGPT_Image_May_12_2025_10_38_52_AM.png" alt="ChatGPT Image May 12, 2025, 10_38_52 AM.png" class="content-image">
