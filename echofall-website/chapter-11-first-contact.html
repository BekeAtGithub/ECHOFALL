                <h1>Chapter 11 - First Contact</h1><h3>I. The Displacement</h3><p>Several days passed after the rover’s descent. Its autopilot remained <strong>paused</strong> by order of the Echofall oversight team.</p><p><p>The science crews back on Earth were overwhelmed. They hadn’t moved the rover more than a few feet from its original landing site. Not because they couldn’t; but because they didn’t have the courage to see more. The live feed continued to point at the pyramid with an ambiguous city littered with megastructures sprawling behind it.</p><p><p>Even within that narrow radius, the data was endless:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Fossilized limbs fused with bulbous organ clusters</li>
<li>Gelatinous mineral deposits that sweated protein mist</li>
<li>Buried shells that hummed in weak thermal resonance</li>
</ul><p>Each layer of terrain peeled back unearthed new horrors:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Slop-evolved fossils with contorted anatomy</li>
<li>Evolutionary trails where survival had spiraled into suffering</li>
<li>Signs of complex motor development that ended mid-adaptation, frozen in death</li>
</ul><p>Earth was building a picture of a planet that never stopped mutating, and never got anything right.</p><p><p><h3>A Shadow in the Past</h3><p>What the crew didn’t know; what they <em>still</em> didn’t know; was that they had triggered a drastic chain of events before they even touched the planet. Like a straight of standing dominos - landing the probe on the meteor was the first one to topple over onto the next.</p><p><p>Back in <strong>2524</strong> While the Echofall vessel was still tethered to its cometary ride, hurtling toward the Nhexus system, it had passed by a distant, unnamed planet.</p><p><p>That planet was Oc’Xari.</p><p><p>From the black oceans of Oc’Xari, a single sensory lattice node registered the passing of something impossible: an object on a meteor ; purposeful, foreign, unexplainable.</p><p><p>Oc’Xari responded.</p><p><p>It created a flotilla of Watchers; quick, subtle, quantum-shadow scouts; and sent them after the object.</p><p><p>They did not ride the meteor.</p><p><p>They simply followed… though they were fast, they lazily lagged behind the meteor. After some time, they finally have arrived to Nhexus.</p><p><p><h3>Glitches and Ghosts</h3><p>It began subtly.</p><p><p>One afternoon, the drone control team went on their standard break rotation. Lunch. Coffee. News.</p><p><p>When they returned, they noticed that the rover’s backup systems had activated without prompt.</p><p><p>Diagnostics were inconclusive. No radiation spike. No collision.</p><p><p>“Might’ve been a solar glitch,” someone said.</p><p><p>“Rover AI sometimes runs failovers if it senses magnetic warping.”</p><p><p>They logged it. Moved on.</p><p><p>Days later, it happened again.</p><p><p>This time, with a brief timestamped image distortion. A flicker. The rover control engineer noticed something tall in the mist, tried to take a picture, but it was gone before it rendered. He glanced over at his squad, they all saw it, but assumed was just a shadow generated by a gust of wind or some other explainable event.</p><p><p>Another log entry. Another shrug.</p><p><p>But the incidents continued; random system flickers, dormant probe warmups for no reason, timestamp gaps, audio static shaped too much like whispering.</p><p><p>Each time, someone reassured the team:</p><p><p>“Old equipment. Dried residue interference. Paranoia.”</p><p><p><h3>Strange Readings</h3><p>During one of the quieter nights in the lab, while most of the crew was filtering scan layers or re-annotating bone cluster models, another glitch occurred.</p><p><p>EON-7b's sensors flagged something; brief, irregular.</p><p><p><ul>
<li>A heat signature, small, narrow, but too warm for ambient fossil residue</li>
<li>A trace EM pulse; tight-band, repeating at 7.2-second intervals, like a signal attempting to mimic something natural</li>
</ul><p>It lasted under thirty seconds.</p><p><p>No movement.</p><p><p>No visible object.</p><p><p>Just… a blip.</p><p><p>Infrared was inconclusive. Thermal readings showed the anomaly moving toward the rover before disappearing entirely. The cameras caught only dust hanging still in the air.</p><p><p>Just rot. Just bones. Just a massive encrusted flesh pyramid.</p><p><p>Just silence.</p><p><p>The system flagged it as a tier-3 environmental anomaly, and someone logged it under non-critical observational interference.</p><p><p>“Probably EM backscatter. Local brine gas spike.”</p><p><p>“Or rover feedback loop.”</p><p><p>One of the junior biologists, half-joking, leaned back in her chair and muttered:</p><p><p>“You think ghosts exist on other planets?”</p><p><p>There was a pause. A brief one.</p><p><p>Then a round of chuckles.</p><p><p>“Yeah. Sure. Nhexus poltergeists.”</p><p><p>“Maybe Slop ghosts are just liquefied regret.”</p><p><p>“Only thing haunting us is newly developed PTSD and sleep deprivation.”</p><p><p>The conversation moved on.</p><p><p>No one truly believed in ghosts, not in that lab.</p><p><p>They were scientists.</p><p><p>Rational. Trained.</p><p><p>But the readings didn’t go away.</p><p><p>Over the next several weeks, they repeated, never the same pattern twice, never the same spot twice.</p><p><p>Always brief.</p><p><p>Always impossible to triangulate.</p><p><p>Small disturbances. Phantom shadows.</p><p><p>Something was <em>near</em> the rover.</p><p><p>Something was <em>watching</em> it.</p><p><p>But no one saw a thing.</p><p><p>They logged it all as sensor interference.</p><p><p>And kept going.</p><p><p>Because the alternative was unacceptable.</p><p><p>There was a tense atmosphere in the control center, people started to get a feeling there might be something out there… maybe not a ghost, but something was watching them, but nobody wanted to talk about it.</p><p><p><h3>The Shift</h3><p>Then came Christmas.</p><p><p>The EON-7b rover was powered off, sitting in front of the pyramid still where they initially landed it. The lab shut down for a week. Holiday breaks. Quiet halls. Dimmed servers.</p><p><p><strong>2531 - Happy New Year.</strong><p>When the crew returned in January, they immediately knew something was wrong.</p><p><p>They powered the EON-7b back on, and the rover’s location data was off.</p><p><p>Completely.</p><p><p>“Did someone run a test sim?”</p><p><p>“Did we move it for heat scans?”</p><p><p>“Did an update trigger a nav ping?”</p><p><p>But the truth was simpler.</p><p><p><strong>EON-7b had moved.</strong><p>Not by a few feet. Not by accident.</p><p><p>It was now parked on a mountaintop overlook, dozens of kilometers from its original landing site.</p><p><p>It stood silently at the edge of a vast, twisted valley.</p><p><p>Below it stretched an endless necropolis; cityscapes built from corpses and calcified organs, ribbed highways of spines, shattered domes grown from living tissue, towers of weeping stone and frozen tendrils reaching toward the gray sun.</p><p><p>Within 20 meters of the rover’s new position, just to its left, something else loomed; a massive… vehicle? partially embedded in the soil and rot.</p><p><p>It had the vague silhouette of a logistics truck… as if designed for industrial shipping or planetary freight, but built from something organic, living, not mechanical.</p><p><p>Its frame was a lattice of calcified vertebrae, interlocked by sinew cabling that pulsed faintly in ambient temperature scans. The “wheels” were folded limbs, jointed and fused into circular motion rigs. A chassis of hardened flesh stitched over interior compartments bulged with ossified ridges.</p><p><p>This… “truck” if we can call it that, has been here for over a hundred thousand years, with a lack of winds and dust on the planet, it seems nothing has been buried through time, it’s been mostly left the way it was when it died out.</p><p><p>They hadn’t moved the rover.</p><p><p>But <em>something had</em>.</p><p><p>And now they stare at the live feed of the rover - looking at an impossible city, in a vast dredging valley, beholding incomprehensible things.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2011%20-%20First%20Contact/480821153_122228753756031351_3053875499275188330_n.jpg" alt="480821153_122228753756031351_3053875499275188330_n.jpg" class="content-image"><p><h3>II. Easter Protocol</h3><p>In the months that followed, the rover barely moved.</p><p><p>Once again, the team at UN-DSDA chose caution over curiosity.</p><p><p>They focused their study on samples and scans taken within reach of the drone's manipulator arms:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Biofilm flakes flaking from the pseudo-truck’s undercarriage</li>
<li>Hardened resin nodes surrounding the weeping city structures below</li>
<li>Fossilized tendril roots growing around the mountain’s edge</li>
</ul><p>No one suggested steering the rover further into the valley.</p><p><p>No one wanted to <em>wake</em> whatever had left the truck there.</p><p><p>The rover sat for months.</p><p><p>Then came spring.</p><p><p>As the team prepared for Easter leave, they agreed to a new protocol.</p><p><p>“No more blind shutdowns.”</p><p><p>The lead systems engineer left EON-7b fully online. They activated continuous live-feed streaming and enabled motion-sensing alerts with real-time push notifications.</p><p><p>If the rover moved more than a few inches, every team member would get a text.</p><p><p>Then they went home.</p><p><p>They ate lamb and drank wine with their families.
They watched the news and pretended the world was still normal.</p><p><p>For two days, the rover remained still.</p><p><p>Then, at 3:41 AM UTC, the first motion alert fired.</p><p><p>Phones buzzed across all members of the project.
Red text. CAPS LOCK.</p><p><p>ROVER MOVEMENT DETECTED</p><p><p>Dozens of staff left during dinner with their families
Some left Easter parties at the bar - still drunk.
Others jumping out of bed, interrupting time with their significant others</p><p><p>Within fifty minutes, the entire lab was online.</p><p><p>And what they saw…</p><p><p>Was insane.</p><p><p>EON-7b was in motion.</p><p><p>Slowly, silently, but unmistakably moving on its own.</p><p><p>There was no AI input.
No navigation commands.
Something else was controlling it.</p><p><p>The camera feed showed jagged terrain passing underfoot as the rover descended the mountain, heading toward the fossil city.</p><p><p>As if something had <em>invited</em> it.</p><p><p><h3>III. Control Room Chaos</h3><p>The lab went quiet.</p><p><p>Dozens of eyes stared at the feed as EON-7b crept its way down the mountain.</p><p><p>One of the senior engineers whispered:</p><p><p>“So, what do we do in this scenario?”</p><p><p>The room turned to the mission commander.</p><p><p>He hesitated. Swallowed.</p><p><p>“Uh… stop the rover.”</p><p><p>The lead systems engineer nodded, hands flying over the console.</p><p><p>He issued a shutdown command, standard sequence.</p><p><p>EON-7b’s feed went dark.</p><p><p>Completely.</p><p><p>No error code.</p><p><p>Returned with a successful shutdown confirmation.</p><p><p>The feed went black.</p><p><p>A moment passed when the commander issued the next step;</p><p><p>“Okay, can you bring it back online?”</p><p><p>The engineer ran the boot command.</p><p><p>Anticipation filled the room.</p><p><p>14 seconds passed.</p><p><p>31 seconds…</p><p><p>Then; the feed returned.</p><p><p>But something had changed.</p><p><p>The camera was no longer pointed at the descending valley.</p><p><p>Now it faced an open desert basin, an endless vast wasteland, flat and pale, with a singular lone structure within about 10 meters of the rover; a building the size of a small house, bulbous and organic in shape.</p><p><p>As the camera lens adjusted, the drone’s automated stillframe system captured an image.</p><p><p>In the frame, a tall, shadowy figure standing right infront of the building.</p><p><p>It had no distinct limbs, but suggestions of posture. Its mass swaying slightly, tapering into vague limbs. Its skin shimmered like chitin soaked in smoke. And as the feed focused… the figure melted into the structure, folding into its walls.</p><p><p>The control room exploded with chatter.</p><p><p>“Did you see that?!”</p><p><p>“Run it again! Enhance the frame!”</p><p><p>“It <em>moved</em>. That thing <em>moved.</em>”</p><p><p>The rover’s internal systems began pulling data on its own:</p><p><p><ul>
<li><strong>Thermal heat spike</strong>, consistent with metabolically active organisms</li>
<li><strong>Radiation bloom</strong> at a frequency consistent with Slop residue</li>
<li><strong>Biomass density</strong> slightly lighter than average human mass</li>
<li><strong>Movement speed</strong>: 4.3 km/h — <em>walking</em></li>
</ul><p>The lead biologist squinted at the screen.</p><p><p>“That’s not a ghost.”</p><p><p>She pulled up the genetic index the AI had begun cross-referencing.</p><p><p>“It’s alive, there’s actually something there.”</p><p><p>There was a pause.</p><p><p><h3>IV. The Realization</h3><p>They replayed the footage a dozen times.</p><p><p>Frame by frame. Pixel by pixel.</p><p><p>Each time, the shadowy figure was there… moving, reacting, disappearing into the organic structure like it belonged there.</p><p><p>But this time, no one joked about ghosts.</p><p><p>No one blamed a glitch.</p><p><p>Because the data was too clean.</p><p><p>The movement registered across every sensor: lidar, thermal, audio displacement, electrostatic drift.</p><p><p>It was clear this thing had been there with us the whole time.</p><p><p>Archive logs were pulled.</p><p><p>System glitches re-examined. The old motion alerts, the backup system pings, the strange EM pulses.</p><p><p>What had once been dismissed as environmental interference now formed a timeline.</p><p><p><ul>
<li>The first anomaly: 23.4 days after landing.</li>
<li>The first EM echo: 27.1 days.</li>
<li>The unexplained camera lens fogging: 31.6 days.</li>
<li>The thermal bloom beneath the rover during week six.</li>
<li>The big move over Christmas Holidays</li>
</ul><p>It’s been with the rover this whole time.</p><p><p>Watching. Studying. Waiting.</p><p><p>A junior systems analyst ran a passive motion map based on old sensor drift logs. The results chilled the room:</p><p><p>The unknown figure had been within thirty meters of the rover on at least eight separate occasions over the last six or so months.</p><p><p>Now it made sense.</p><p><p>“It was curious.”</p><p><p>“We weren’t alone from the start.”</p><p><p>”It might be just as confused and afraid of our rover as we are of it.”</p><p><p>It was now a first contact event.</p><p><p><h3>V. The Unthinkable Coincidence</h3><p>Every screen in the control center was alive with data, alarms softly blinking, comms chatter buzzing from translation relays.</p><p><p>The lead astrophysicist stared at the screen.</p><p><p>"Is this some survivor of this planet?"</p><p><p>the Lead Systems Engineer responds;</p><p><p>“Don’t let the pope find out, he will claim it’s Jesus or something”</p><p><p>They began cataloging everything:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>The temperature ranges the figure preferred</li>
<li>The times it approached the rover</li>
<li>The patterns in the EM pulses, now confirmed to be intentional, not language, not Morse, but structured curiosity</li>
</ul><p>Someone in the linguistics team called it:</p><p><p>"A form of observational language."</p><p><p>Never before had humanity made contact with anything alien, and now they discovered two alien anomalies at once… one ancient and dead, and the other foreign and aware; both intertwined in the same moment, on the same cursed planet.</p><p><p>"We saw a fast meteor, we sent a rover, to simply discover more.
Then by dumb luck, we found a horrifically disfigured extinct world."
”We’ve been studying it for close to a year.”</p><p><p>"And this whole time something else has been studying <em>us</em>."
”We have no idea what it is. But we know it’s real.”</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2011%20-%20First%20Contact/u8296664269_black_shadow_ethereal_ghost_in_a_vast_wasteland_b_2b116b35-c925-48c1-9ad1-e87dd5bfe33d_0.png" alt="u8296664269_black_shadow_ethereal_ghost_in_a_vast_wasteland_b_2b116b35-c925-48c1-9ad1-e87dd5bfe33d_0.png" class="content-image">
