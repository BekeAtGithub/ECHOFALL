                <h1>Chapter 8 - Sky Market Traders</h1><strong>Kavariin</strong><p>“Kavariin - a planet of rich life which precedes the LUCA Seed, existing far before “The Ancient Ones”- of this books Prologue.
Born of predators, the Avaris could have ruled by fang and talon.
But they chose trade, not war.
Culture, not conquest.
The Great Skies, Sun and Stars.”</p><p><p><h3>I. Planet Overview</h3><p><ul>
<li><strong>Name:</strong> Kavariin (self-designated)</li>
<li><strong>LUCA Seed Code:</strong> N/A - not a LUCA related planet - entirely different genetic pattern</li>
<li><strong>Size:</strong> 1.09 Earth radii</li>
<li><strong>Gravity:</strong> 0.94G (ideal for flight)</li>
<li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Rich in oxygen and trace aromatics; supportive of both powered and biological flight</li>
<li><strong>Climates:</strong> Diverse ; thick jungles, crimson deserts, polar spires, and canopy-covered archipelagos</li>
<li><strong>Moons:</strong> Two ; gentle tidal interactions; primary moon used as a creative sanctuary</li>
</ul><p><A city designed to inspire wonder, awe and reflection><p><img src="images/Chapter%208%20-%20Sky%20Market%20Traders/486076052_122234632106031351_6659266259218191399_n.jpg" alt="486076052_122234632106031351_6659266259218191399_n.jpg" class="content-image"><p><h3>II. The Species: The Avaris</h3><p>The Avaris were descended from dominant aerial predators ; six-limbed vertebrates with:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Massive feathered wings, diverse in colors, shapes and patterns, as well as arms with hands, and bipedal with legs and feet</li>
<li>Talon-graspers at mid-wing joints, allowing for fine manipulation of tools, instruments, and surgical devices</li>
<li>Advanced vocal range capable of harmonizing in multiple frequencies at once</li>
<li>Complex binocular and thermal vision, refined during their ancestral hunting epochs</li>
</ul><p>Despite being born killers, their predatory past did not define their future.</p><p><p>What separated the Avaris from the others wasn’t intelligence ; it was morality and social maturity as their culture and politics progressed</p><p><p><h3>III. Evolution Into Omnivory - The Ethical Revolution</h3><p>The Avaris retained their carnivorous biology well into early civilization.</p><p><p>But as their culture matured, they began asking questions:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>“Why must sentience come from suffering?”</li>
<li>“Can we not evolve what nature failed to perfect?”</li>
<li>“Is taste a cruelty, or just chemistry?”</li>
</ul><p>Their answer: bio-directed evolution.</p><p><p>Through deliberate gene editing, they transitioned to omnivory ; enhancing digestive efficiency, minimizing energy waste, and expanding their gustatory palate. Then came the true breakthrough:</p><p><p>A global embrace of lab-grown flesh.</p><p><p><h3>IV. The Lab-Meat Renaissance</h3><p>They perfected cultured meat far beyond human attempts ; to the point that:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Wagyu-tier fibers were replicated precisely through genetic tuning of tension thresholds</li>
<li>Brisket-style fat distributions were engineered from vat-grown lipid chambers</li>
<li>Ribs, loins, and tendons were layered mechanically to create pull-apart satisfaction</li>
<li>Flavors could be programmed ; from smoky to gamey to spiced ; without harming a single living thing</li>
</ul><p>These living taste sculptures were crafted not in slaughterhouses, but in culinary art labs ; run by chefs and biochemists, not butchers.</p><p><p><h3>V. Rewilding the Planet - No More Farms</h3><p>With meat, textiles, and proteins synthesized:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>No farmland was needed</li>
<li>Grazing lands were reforested</li>
<li>Oceans were no longer fished, only studied and celebrated</li>
<li>Entire valleys once cleared for crops became cultural sanctuaries</li>
</ul><p>Their cities were woven into cliffs, floating on thermal updrafts, or suspended from massive skyroots.</p><p><p>Instead of supermarkets and grain silos, each district had a flavor cathedral - part restaurant, part theater, part sculptural garden.</p><p><p>There, Avaris flocked not to consume, but to commune.</p><p><p><h3>VI. Society of the Sky</h3><p>The Avaris built their civilization on abundance and movement:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Trade networks formed between floating platforms and sky-harbors</li>
<li>Knowledge temples offered free education in philosophy, song, and flight choreography</li>
<li>Art sanctuaries dotted across the planet’s most scenic regions, where citizens were encouraged to perform, paint, invent, or simply be witnessed</li>
</ul><p>With scarcity eliminated, the primary motivators became:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Recognition</li>
<li>Beauty</li>
<li>Legacy</li>
</ul><p>Avaris no longer asked <em>“What do I own?”</em> but <em>“What did I create that others will remember?”</em></p><p><p><h3>VII. Deep Space Harmony</h3><p>Once deep-space mining was fully automated, resources were extracted without cost, or labor - and only polluting, mining, and producing mass factories.</p><p><p>Terraforming projects began on:</p><p><p><ul>
<li><strong>Tethra</strong> (moon of the outer gas giant ; turned into a polar spa-temple)</li>
<li><strong>Maazari</strong> (small inner planet ; converted into a massive wing-dance amphitheater)</li>
<li><strong>Cloudstone</strong> (orbital station of frozen gas-petals, home to scent poets and acoustic sculptors)</li>
</ul><p>Avaris citizens could request their own homes on each planet, custom designed and freely given through public consensus.</p><p><p>Apply. Be approved. Receive.</p><p><p>No debt. No ownership.</p><p><p>Only place and purpose.</p><p><p><h3>VIII. Still Alone - But Still Looking</h3><p>The Kavariin is one of the original planets in the designed universe, and the Avaris are just as ancient as the Ancient Ones who created the LUCA Canon.</p><p><p>The Avaris are pre-LUCA life, unrelated to the synthetic seed.</p><p><p>Despite having mapped every object in their solar system, contacted no one, and discovered no alien artifact, the Avaris continued to search the stars.</p><p><p>They sang transmissions into the void.</p><p><p>They left feather-scribed sky-prayers on asteroids.</p><p><p>They painted orbital murals using solar-reflective nanogel, just in case someone was watching..</p><p><p>Never found Earth.</p><p><p>Never knew of the ancient ones, or the LUCA, or the Oc’Xari, or anything.</p><p><p>Never knew what they’d survived.</p><p><p>As far as the Avaris knew- they were the only species in the universe, and they still have yet to discover the origins of how life began on their own planet.</p><p>
