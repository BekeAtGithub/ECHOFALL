                <h1>Chapter 41 - Saskatchewan</h1><h3>Another Round in Saskatchewan</h3><p><strong>Swift Current, Saskatchewan - 11:47 PM</strong><p>After a nonstop one-shot drive across the stretching Canadian prairie, mostly taking the smaller lesser known highways to try and evade police looking for the stolen vehicle along the Trans-Canada Highway. Dmitry and Steven finally rolled into the outskirts of Swift Current under a dim, frost-bitten sky. The journey had been long ; mostly silent ; with only occasional bursts of conversation to break the tension. Neither man had much left to say. Their thoughts ran in circles, spiraling around the same three possibilities: deliver the artifact, defy the Pig, or gamble on something even riskier.</p><p><p>They’d stopped twice for gas, once for snacks ; each time brief, silent, mechanical. The roads had been clear, eerie in their emptiness, the highways ghostlike beneath the dim shimmer of the slowly rising moon.</p><p><p>By the time they reached the heart of the town, it was nearing midnight. The place looked dead. Frozen. The sidewalks were glazed in layers of old ice, the roads half-lit by flickering yellow lamps. Everything had that abandoned feel ; as if even time had forgotten Swift Current.</p><p>
