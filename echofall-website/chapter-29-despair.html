                <h1>Chapter 29 - Despair</h1><h3><strong>Two Years Since the Police Raid at Red’s Ranch</strong></h3><p><strong>Day 821 of prison</strong><p>There were no more dreams.</p><p><p>No more signs. No symbols in the macaroni. No letters in the shower steam. No smudged alphabets in reflections.</p><p><p>Just the weight of memory.</p><p><p>And the haunted feeling of something watching… but never revealing itself.</p><p><p>Steven Young was the first to leave the facility.</p><p><p>The release papers said 821 days served. Early due to “demonstrated behavioral reformation” and a recommendation from the medical examiner citing “sub-clinical dissociation, likely prison-induced.”</p><p><p>They didn’t know it was the Pig that took his voice.</p><p><p>He didn’t smile when he stepped out of the gates.</p><p><p>Didn’t joke about gator hunting.</p><p><p>Didn’t spit a line of redneck wisdom.</p><p><p>He was quiet.</p><p><p>And that silence carried him all the way back to Tampa, Florida ; what was left of it.</p><p><p>The sky was grayer with smog. The streets were hotter. The oceans sat higher against cracked sea walls. The beaches littered with dog shit, garbage and homeless encampments.</p><p><p>Steven found a job delivering drone-dropped parcels for a mid-tier logistics company.</p><p><p>Owned, as irony would have it, by James Bethoz ; a name he couldn’t escape even now.</p><p><p>Steven’s resume said he once drove a rover on an alien planet. But nobody remembered - or cared, so now he wore a shirt that said “SwiftXpress”. He wear a VR headset he’d use to control drones for 12 hours a day delivering boxes of nutrient paste, disposable clothes, and AR goggles to wage-slaved tenants in vertical housing blocks that stretched so high they cut the sun in half.</p><p><p>Dmitry Alexeyev was processed a few weeks later and dumped back in Seattle.</p><p><p>He used to monitor interstellar transmissions.</p><p><p>He used to track anomalous quantum frequencies from satellites above the Nhexus system.</p><p><p>Now?</p><p><p>He mopped floors in a bio-plastic factory that smelled like boiling piss and fungal disinfectant.</p><p><p>Night shifts. Always night shifts.</p><p><p>He said it was because he couldn’t sleep.</p><p><p>But the truth was, he was afraid to.</p><p><p>The silence of the factory at 4:03 AM - that was when the fear came back.</p><p><p>The two men ; once legends in the Echofall Initiative ; now separately rented a slum module provisioned by the Emerald District Hive Program, a bottom-tier government-subsidized project of residential concrete stacks surrounded by graffiti, piled up garbage, junk drones, drug addicts, gangsters, crack whores and faulty neon signs.</p><p><p>They ate instant ramen.</p><p><p>Only had access to hot water twice a week.</p><p><p>Kept the lights off to save power credits.</p><p><p>The world moved on without them.</p><p><p>Alien dreams? Oc’Xari?</p><p><p>Slop worlds and thread cities?</p><p><p>No one remembered.</p><p><p>Nobody believed it.</p><p><p>And nobody cared.</p><p><p>Dmitry and Steven lived their own lives, apart in solitude for the next 8 years.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2029%20-%20Despair/despair.png" alt="despair.png" class="content-image"><p><h3></h3>
