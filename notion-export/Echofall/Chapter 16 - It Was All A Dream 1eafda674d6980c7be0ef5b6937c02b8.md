# Chapter 16 - It Was All A Dream

### I. A Kickin’ Wranglin’ Cowboy

Going back to Dallas on the bucket, he had just finished his song, with no idea that it was projecting across the planet and beyond.

He looked up at the alien.

The Oc’Xari did something strange; an advanced signal completely foreign to human understanding. But somehow, Dallas knew exactly what it meant. It was a cheer of approval. A silent, resonant kind of joy. The alien was pleased.

With a sudden gust of wind, the barn door swung shut; not slamming, but gently closing itself as if with care.

The Oc’Xari was gone.

Dallas stood up slowly.

Turned around.

And blinked.

The bucket he had been sitting on was already back on the shelf he had taken it from.

But that wasn’t all.

The entire rear portion of the barn; where he’d had his back turned; had changed. It still had the same country-western soul, the same rust-stained charm… but now it was *refined*. Reinforced.

The old wood was replaced with rich, varnished grain. The hinges on the tools gleamed; in silver, some in gold. The walls held strong, fine steel bracing between them. Everything was improved; but nothing felt out of place. It still felt like *his* barn.

He gasped.

Turned toward the front door again.

And now the *entire* barn was like that; quietly, lovingly renovated. No noise. No fuss.

Dallas rubbed the back of his neck, wide-eyed, then chuckled.

“Now that’s what I call an alien invasion.”

He didn’t care much for material things; but this? This felt like a thank-you.

He strolled out of the barn, calm and whistling.

His fields were mowed. His old, beat-up house looked just like it did when he first had it built; nothing modern or flashy; just… restored. The wood looked cleaner. The porch straighter. The paint just a bit more vivid in the late sun. And in the driveway glistened a brand new 1950s Ford F1 pickup truck (keep in mind the year is about 2535), Dallas spent some time appreciating the renovations, the hard yard work, and the truck that shouldn’t exist in this year… He sat in the truck, opened the glovebox, the truck was actually insured to a man named “James Bethoz.” It was a collector vehicle stolen by the aliens from a billionaires garage, and relocated to Dallas Red’s driveway.

“Heh, and the news said we should be scared of aliens… I suppose I should cover the truck with a tarp incase someone comes looking for it.” 

He covered the truck and he spent the rest of the day pondering it all.

The encounter.

The alien.

The guitar.

The free renovations.

The truck.

He sat at his kitchen table, gently cradling the engraved guitar in his lap. The markings along the wood; the map; made no damn sense to him. Looked like a child’s doodles mixed with the circuits from a super ai computer.

And then there was the floating thing above the strings.

It wasn’t solid.

More like a shimmer; a projection hanging in the air, flickering like oil in moonlight.

Every time he brought his hand near it, it would respond; humming, pulsing, alive.

And when he finally touched it? It was like he turned on a projector.

The walls lit up; beams of light displaying screens like in Ironman sprawled across his appliances, painting strange glyphs and alien interfaces in every direction. It was like a spaceship had unfolded into his house.

He quickly panic reacted.

“Oh shit; how do I turn this off?!”

And the moment he *thought* it; the projections vanished.

Just gone.

Silence again.

Later, when he wanted music, the shimmer would play it for him; somehow knowing just the tune he wanted. When he went to clean his stove, the shimmer pulsed and emitted a ray of soft light that instantly cleaned the surface spotless.

It didn’t ask permission.

It just *helped*.

And Dallas?

Dallas just sat there, guitar across his knee, staring at the thing in amused disbelief.

“Well… I’ll be a six-legged donkey.” - he chuckled again

He wasn’t scared.

He was a bit confused. But he just grinned.

And poured himself a drink.

### II. The Dream at the Chuckwagon Café

Dallas finished his dinner with a slow chew, wiping the last of his beans with a heel of sourdough. On the kitchen table beside him sat a local newspaper, folded to a story about the Commander; headline circled in red ink:

"Echofall Commander Faces Final Hearing Amid Accusations of Mass Global Scale Fraud, Delusion and Conspiracy."

Dallas scratched his chin, took a long sip of water, and glanced at the photo.

“Aren’t you in a mess…” he muttered. “I’d buy you a drink if I ever met ya.”

He folded the paper with a sigh, cleared his plate, padded over to bed, and fell sound asleep.

The guitar leaned against the corner wall, glowing softly in the dim light.

**The dream came fast. Too vivid to question.**

He was sitting at a worn bar counter inside the Chuckwagon Café; a dusty saloon in Diamond Valley, Alberta, a place he’s never been in before, but a place he totally digs.

The light was warm and gold. The air smelled of sawdust, burnt sugar, and pine smoke. 

Dallas leaned forward, pressed the little brass bell on the bar top with the back of his knuckle.

Ding.

The kitchen service door behind the bar swung open; softly, smoothly.

Out walked the Oc’Xari.

Same one from the barn. Silent. Serene. Still faceless, but no longer unknowable. This time it wore a long apron dusted with flour and soot, moving with practiced grace. In three elongated arms it carried three glasses of moonshine, perfectly clear and glowing faintly like bottled lightning.

Dallas raised a brow.

“Three? Little much for just me, ain’t it?”

The Oc’Xari said nothing.

It floated one glass toward Dallas.

Another to the man now seated beside him; a soldier, his silhouette sharpened by age and weight. Steel-grey hair. Rough, unkempt, sleepless, stressed. Eyes that have seen horror darker than any mortal man. A soul that has hurt, more than any could bare. Slouched on the chair.

The Commander.

The same one from the newspaper.

Before either could speak, the Oc’Xari pressed play on an old jukebox.

Dallas’ song. The one he played in the barn. The one the whole world heard, once.

It spilled into the saloon like syrupy light; golden and slow, rich and haunting, like honey on pancakes, and holy water through cathedral bells.

The three raised their glasses instinctively.

Clink.

They drank.

And then they danced.

The Oc’Xari; learned to line dance quick as it stood beside Dallas, as he laughed loud, stomping the floorboards to the beat of the blues. Dallas yelled;

“What’s your shoe size?” he said through a wheeze. “We gotta get you a pair of cowboy boots.”

In the logic of dreams, the Commander suddenly found himself holding a pair of boots.

He hesitated; utterly baffled at the absurdity of what was happening. He looked around as if trying to find the hidden camera, the rational thread, the part where someone explains *why* he’s fitting an alien with *cowhide footwear* in a saloon he’d never seen before.

“Am I on one of those reality prank TV shows?” he muttered to no one.

Still, he knelt down and helped the Oc’Xari slide in.

No one spoke.

But everyone understood.

The saloon glowed with laughter and warmth. The alien never said a word. Didn’t need to.

It was home here.

And then; like all fever dreams do; it changed.

They were outside.

In the wide, open prairie of Dallas’ ranch, the sky soft and blushed with twilight.

And in every direction…

Thousands of Oc’Xari dancing, like it was a music festival in California.

All wearing cowboy hats, bolo ties and boots.

The kids back from the refugee camp were there in the dream too that night - playing with a six legged donkey. 

All dancing, drinking moonshine, sitting around campfires, barbecuing ribs and brisket, helping with an assortment of chores around the farm.

It was so gloriously, stupidly, impossibly beautiful that the Commander whispered aloud:

“This is the dumbest, most incredible moment of my life.”

And he meant it.

**Dallas woke up.**

Sunlight leaked in through the windows like spilled whiskey.

He sat up slowly from his bed, blinking through haze and confusion.

The guitar glowed.

Brighter than before.

And above the strings hovered a projected message, swirling in soft light:

"Location Saved: Chuckwagon Café, Diamond Valley AB

**Time: 4:00 PM | Date: One week from today."**

Dallas stared.

Then noticed the same message, handwritten in his own crooked scrawl, pinned to the fridge with a cracked horseshoe magnet.

He chuckled.

“Guess I already knew.”

He underlined the date twice and stuck the note back with a gentle tap.

“Wouldn’t wanna be late.”

### III. Meanwhile, in Fort Campbell, Tennessee…

The Commander shot up in bed like a man struck by lightning.

Sweat glued his undershirt to his chest. His heartbeat echoed like a drumline.

His TV was on.

The screen glowed soft blue static, with no signal and no source, and in the center:

CHUCKWAGON CAFÉ – DIAMOND VALLEY AB

**TIME: 4:00 PM – ONE WEEK FROM TODAY**

He blinked once.

Twice.

Then rubbed his face like he was trying to wake up a second time.

“The *what* cafe-*where*?”

He didn’t recognize the bar or the town.

Didn’t know the man with the guitar.

He didn’t even see the Oc’Xari clearly in his dream.

But he remembered the song.

The same song that once blared through every communication system on Earth.

The same song that interrupted a court hearing meant to dismantle his career.

The same song that blared away on the haunted dead slop wastelands of Nhexus 

He sat at the edge of the bed, elbows on knees, eyes locked to the screen.

“This is insane.”

He shook his head.

And started searching for flights to Calgary, Alberta - he booked his flight about a week in advance - exactly 6 days from now, so he can land a day early to get there on time the next day. He’s never been to Calgary, so he needed the time to get situated. 

### IV. The Fallout

That morning, the commander made breakfast for his wife and kids, who worried for him dearly as he left his house living his last day as a free man; or close enough to it.

The dream still clung to him in phantom warmth: the Chuckwagon Café, the clink of glasses, that damn line-dancing alien in size 45 boots. The music. The light. The impossible calm.

But Earth didn’t run on dreams.

Earth ran on paperwork.

And today… his name was on every form that mattered.

He arrived at the courtroom in a sharp, perfect suit, and a face that hadn’t slept.

The courtroom was quiet, heavy with that familiar tension; half legal process, half public theater.

The Commander sat at the defense table, hands folded, expression unreadable. His lawyer, a wiry woman with steel in her spine; adjusted her glasses and leaned into the mic.

Defense: "We submit, once again, that the data presented during the Echofall mission was interpreted in good faith, with real-time decision-making under extraordinary circumstances"

Prosecutor (cutting in): “Good faith doesn’t explain falsified threat assessments, overspending on defense infrastructure, or activating global alert protocols without verifiable evidence of a threat.”

Defense: “Verifiable to whom? The data remains intact with clear evidence.”

Judge: “Let’s not repeat the last two weeks, Counselor. We are here to determine responsibility for mass panic, misuse of international scientific resources, and global psychological harm. Stick to what’s new.”

The prosecutor turned to the Commander.

Prosecutor: “Do you deny that under your authority, your team escalated an ambiguous extraterrestrial signal into a planetary emergency?”

Commander: (quietly) “No.”

Prosecutor: “Do you regret the global consequences of that decision?”

Commander: (pausing, choosing) “…I regret that the world shut out real evidence when the truth got inconvenient.”

Murmurs in the gallery.

The judge banged her gavel once.

Judge: “That’s enough. Mr. Commander, you’ve been under conditional release pending resolution of these hearings. Do you have any further requests at this time?”

The Commander stood slowly. His lawyer shot him a glance; unsure. He took a breath.

Commander: “Yes, Your Honor. I’d like to request temporary leave from state jurisdiction.”

Judge: “For what purpose?”

Commander: “A funeral. Family friends. Calgary, Alberta.”

A pause.

The judge arched a brow. Looked down at the file.

Judge: “You’re asking to leave the country in the middle of your own trial?”

Commander: (steady) “I’ll be back in three days. No longer.”

Prosecutor: “We object; this feels unwise given the gravity of”

Judge: (holding up a hand) “Three days. No extensions. You may leave at the end of this week. Return by the third sunrise after or you forfeit bail and face immediate incarceration. Understood?”

The Commander nodded once.

Commander: “Understood, Your Honor.”

The gavel struck again.

And with that, the path to Diamond Valley… was officially open.

After the morning trial, he went down to the science space center to his cubicle, as he attempted to login to the computer - it showed an error ‘Account Locked’

About an hour later, the head of HR came by with a manila envelope, slid it across his desk.

He hadn’t opened it right away.

After some time of staring at it, clicking his pen, he let’s out a sigh and finally, he opened it.

Inside:

- Termination papers
- A severance check
- And for the first time since the trial began; his full name, printed cold and clean:

Zhang, Haoyu – Clearance Revoked

Effective Immediately

He stared at it a while. No emotion on his face. Then folded the letter in half once… then again… and slid it beneath the coaster on his desk like it didn’t matter.

Because maybe it didn’t.

Everyone who touched the Echofall project; every engineer, advisor, and analyst; either:

- Laid off quietly
- Transferred to unrelated departments
- Or threatened outright

“If you speak to the press, the board, or each other about the project; you’re done.”

“This is national stability, not science.”

“You want your pension? You will probably have to server some jail time for media publicity… Just swallow your pride, get it over with and keep your mouth shut.”

It wasn’t even subtle.

By noon, the juniors; fresh-faced interns and grad students; were assigned new instructions.

They were ordered to begin dismantling the network:

- Wipe the rover’s uplink logs.
- Shut down the Echofall comms server.
- Archive everything into encrypted cold storage.
- Power down the last monitoring relay on Nhexus.

“Pretend it never happened.”

“Back to normal.”

The press was merciless.

The public had moved on.

No one wanted to hear about slop, ghost signals, rover visions, or invisible alien cowboys.

And for the first time - A rover… an advanced piece of human technology from Earth lays disconnected on another world. Left to rot like the planet it was left on.

The commander sat on a concrete bench across from the federal building, envelope still in hand, tie half-removed, depression in his eyes.

The dream still lingered in his bones.

He looked down at his phone. The glowing message from the TV; now burned into his retinas; was still sitting in his Notes app.

CHUCKWAGON CAFÉ – DIAMOND VALLEY AB

*TIME: 4:00 PM – ONE WEEK FROM TODAY*

He pulled out a cigarette.

Lit it with trembling fingers.

Took one long drag.

Then whispered, to no one in particular:

“If I’m gonna get arrested for something… might as well be for showing up to a bar in Alberta and having a drink with a cowboy and an alien.”

He flicked the ash.

And started planning his trip.

### V. The Return Home

His key turned in the lock at 2:32 PM.

The house greeted him with still air and stale silence. His boots hit the hardwood with the same rhythm they had for years, but now it felt like walking into someone else’s life.

There was no smell of dinner.

No warm music in the kitchen.

Just a stack of overdue letters on the credenza and a magnet note from his youngest:

“Science fair soon! 🧪 :)”

He sighed. Rubbed his brow.

Set his jacket on the hook like it still meant something.

He sat down in an old couch in the living room which he bought when he first purchased the house over a decade ago. It was the longest he’s ever sat in that couch since. Haoyu sat in silence, listening to the clicking of a clock on the wall. 

Thinking back to everything - from the meteor, to Nhexus, to the alien planet of Oc’Xari, to the invasion clouds, the riots and wars that broke out on Earth over it, and the dream from last night.

A couple hours later, the door opened.

His wife came in; eyes tired but alert. She looked at him, read the room instantly.

No hug. No words.

Just a long glance.

Then the sound of school backpacks and shuffling feet.

His two kids; the son, barely ten, and the daughter is 6; walked in behind her, arguing about a vending machine.

They saw him.

Paused.

The little one said, gently:

“Hi, Baba.”

He smiled, best he could.

“Hey, kiddo.”

And that was that.

### VI. Dinner, in Truth

Within less than an hour, the table was set with care, even if it wasn’t said aloud.

- A platter of hong shao rou, the pork belly cooked the night before - glistening with deep caramelized glaze.
- Steamed pork buns, delicate, with ginger and scallion oil spooned over the top.
- A side of garlic stir-fried choy sum still sizzling in the ceramic.
- Warm rice bowls. A half-poured pot of jasmine tea.

Haoyu Zhang sat down last.

He hadn’t spoken much since coming home.

The silence of the family was heavier than the food.

He took a bite. Chewed. Swallowed.

“I might need to go up north,” he said.

His wife paused in mid-sip.

“Work?”

He glanced at her. The corners of his mouth twitched into the ghost of a smile.

“Something like that.”

A beat of silence.

He set his chopsticks down.

“Well… now my clearance is revoked,” he said, voice almost amused. “I guess I don’t have to keep secrets anymore.”

She looked up slowly.

“What secrets?”

He exhaled hard through his nose. Leaned back in his chair. Then spoke.

And rambled.

He told her everything he had to keep a secret from even his own family over the past decade.

Echofall.

The meteor.

Nhexus. The fossil city. The pyramid.

The screaming silence.

The genetic match.

Oc’Xari. The shadows. The anomaly. The watcher.

The way the world pretended to forget. The way they punished him for remembering.

She didn’t interrupt once.

Not during the part about the rover.

Not when he mentioned that the creature had touched it.

Not even when he said; “we’re not alone, and we never were.”

Then he paused.

Lifted his tea cup.

Drank.

Set it down.

“Remember that weird country song that played on the radio all over the world?”

She responds… “Yeah that was really weird, and people have been talking about it all over social media…” 

He followed up;
“Well, last night, I had a dream.”

He described the saloon.

Chuckwagon Café.

“I was sitting beside this old cowboy

This alien thing that I’ve never seen before, pours us moonshine 

Then it starts singing that song from the radio, and before we knew it, we were partying with aliens

Then I woke up - and the TV was on, displaying an address of the saloon and a time stamp”

She blinked.

“You think it was real? Did you hallucinate it onto the TV?”

He looked at her.

Eyes worn from courtrooms, years of silence, and a world that stopped believing in wonder.

“Before Nhexus? I’d have said I was losing my mind.”

He paused.

“But after seeing a pyramid made of alien spines… and seeing rover footage of an entity from another planet standing in the fog of a dead world”

Another breath.

“I don’t think ‘real’ means what it used to.”

She looked down. Quietly pushed a few grains of rice around her bowl.

Then she looked up.

Softly.

“So… what happens next?”

He didn’t know.

But he found himself smiling; just barely.

“I think I’m going to Alberta.”

And she didn’t laugh.

She just nodded.

Then reached for the tea, poured them both a cup, and said:

“You’ll need a warm coat. I read once that Canada still freezes in the spring.”

### VII. Lights Out

Later that night, the hallway lights were off.

The house had gone quiet, save for the soft hum of the heater pushing warm air into the corners of the room. From outside, the Tennessee winds whispered through the pine.

Haoyu sat on the edge of the bed, half-undressed, rolling his socks off one foot at a time. His wife stood at the bathroom sink, brushing her hair in the dim glow.

They didn’t talk much. But not because there was nothing to say.

They’d already said it.

When she came back into the bedroom, she found him lying back against the pillows, one hand resting on his chest, the other loosely clutching the old newspaper clipping he’d circled; the one with his own face, half-shadowed under the words *Mass Fraud* and *Delusion*.

She slid under the blanket next to him. For a moment, they just listened to each other breathe.

Then, softly:

“You sure it was a cowboy?” she asked, a small smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.

He smirked through his nose.

“Boots. Hat. Accent like he invented the word ‘reckon.’ Yeah, it was a cowboy.”

She chuckled.

“So, what… this cowboy and an alien walk into a bar…”

He turned his head toward her.

“You’re mocking interstellar prophecy now?”

She raised an eyebrow. “Something like that.”

Haoyu responded “I think we have another prophecy we need to fulfill” 

A soft click sounded as he reached across and turned off the bedside lamp.

More details don’t need to be said, if you know, you know what happened next.

Once all was said and done, they fell asleep.
