# Chapter 28 - Thesselvine

### I. A Whimsical World

The road wound gently, as if drawn by an artist’s hand across a tapestry. Sunrays danced through the massive green canopy overhead, dappling the path in soft gold.

They passed woven creatures lying across streams like bridges ; massive silken beings whose bodies formed pathways over slow-moving creeks. Here and there, a pond reflected violet skybeasts overhead. Thread-covered huts were nestled in mossy knolls, with no smoke rising from their chimneys, no doors ajar. No people, or elves, or aliens or whatever.

Just movement in the periphery ; a curtain drawn just before they looked, a furry door shuttering behind a silken leaf.

“Feels like deer season,” Steven whispered, eyes darting.

Dmitry paused as a large hairy woven creature slowly stretched out from behind a tree and covered a nearby home like a curtain ; hiding its occupants in a soft cocoon of fur and thread.

Eventually, the forest path curled toward a clearing where a sign stood. It was elegant ; large, woven into a natural archway of vines and threaded rootwork. Silk letters glittered across its surface, like embroidered starlight.

Dmitry stepped forward first, his hand tracing the glyphs slowly.

“Thess... el... vine...”

“Thesselvine.”

Steven let out a low whistle.

“It’s The Vine!”

“Yeah, the Vine” Dmitry muttered.

They crossed the sign into a settlement so seamlessly grown from the forest that it was almost hard to tell where nature stopped and civilization began. Small woven buildings clung to the trees like moss, and thread bridges connected everything in layers and spirals. The homes looked like bundled flower buds, waiting to bloom.

Still ; not a soul in sight.

Just more hushed movement behind petal-curtains and twitching vines.

Steven adjusted his belt.

“Well, either we stumbled into a giant hamster village, or this is what blanket-kitty-fort-heaven looks like when it’s shy.”

Dmitry stopped at another small sign near the town center ; this one more recent, written in careful, simple glyphs, like those in the children’s book.

He read it slowly.

“Memory fades slower… when spoken aloud.”

They stood in silence, reading it twice. Three times.

Then Dmitry looked around and whispered:

“We’re being watched.”

“Yeah,” Steven said. “Let’s give ‘em a show.”

And with that, they stepped into Thesselvine ; the village of thread and silence ; where fate had led them, and something deeper was waiting to be remembered.

They moved carefully now, the signs growing more frequent and deliberate.

Each signpost split into several directions, the winding paths of Thesselvine marked with silk-stitched glyphs and simple icons ; some showing symbols like fruit, others resembling musical shapes or spiraling plants.

But one icon stood out.

It was a building… or, at least, a symbol of one ; shaped like a cocoon unfolding, with a faint glowing thread spiraling out from its center.

“Looks like a dang bug church,” Steven muttered.

Dmitry tilted his head.

“No… more like a center. A core. An archive?”

Each sign bore the same glyph beside the icon, a word neither of them could fully translate… but they’d seen it enough to piece together a guess:

"Thēras’hil."

Whatever it meant, they followed it.

The further they walked, the less deserted the village became.

While the outer homes had been abandoned at their approach, this central district had movement ; cautious, yes, but not vanished.

Sylver elves moved between open-weave market booths, some carrying bushels of bioluminescent berries, others trailing threads from looms they wore on their backs. A pair of Weavers slithered past, carrying a cart made of vines and insect-like shells.

Many still watched Dmitry and Steven with uneasy glances, pausing mid-conversation or retreating behind walls ; but not fleeing.

Here, people still had things to do.

And they were doing them, even if under silent scrutiny.

“Looks like the downtown core,” Steven said.

Dmitry didn’t answer. He was scanning the buildings, all low and curved, half-grown into the forest itself ; yet all clearly functional, purposeful, and alive. Every home had some part of a living organism woven into it ; pulsing veins of color, shifting light panels, breathing walls.

And then; 

They found it.

The final sign, larger than the others, stood mounted on a curled arch of tree root and webbed thread. The icon was clear now ; unmistakable.

A sanctum.

Thēras’hil.

“Center of… something,” Dmitry whispered.

“Maybe ‘Artifact Museum.’ Or ‘Vault.’”

Ahead lay a strange facility ; it looked like a massive white cocoon woven in spider web. Its perimeter was defined by a fence-like structure, but no Earthly chain-link could match what they saw.

A living Weaver, enormous, its coat bristling with black coarse fibers like jagged glass or obsidian, had curled itself around the area, forming a wall. The hair quivered when the wind touched it ; but even the wind seemed reluctant.

And at the entrance, guarding the gate where the creature's silk had parted slightly like curtain folds, stood two Sylver soldiers.

These weren’t like the others.

Their armor was not thread, not silk, it almost looked like a weird type of processed hardened, enchanted amber resin.

Their weapons ; scissor-like polearms; were forged from that same resin material, with veins of fossilized fiber running through their handles.

They didn’t raise their weapons. But they didn’t step aside either.

The guards bowed.

Not in deference, but in formal recognition.

Dmitry bowed slightly in return. Steven half-bowed, mostly waved.

“Guess this is the right place,” Steven muttered.

“Either that, or we’re about to get shaved alive.”

Dmitry stepped toward the gate.

The guards didn’t move at first.

They stood motionless ; expressions unreadable, hands resting atop their strange shears, eyes gleaming faintly beneath softly glowing hoods of that hardened armor.

Dmitry hesitated.

Then stepped closer to the gate, squaring his shoulders.

He took a slow breath, reached back into the faded corners of his memory ; tracing stitched letters in the air with his mind ; and spoke.

“Thesselvine… Thēras’hil… uh…”

“Zra’kok shel’viv… uhnarh-ka’nuh… *zorak peb’l nu gruut…*”

The sentence was jagged. Misshapen. Probably criminal to their grammar.

It roughly translated to:

“We are here… I ask humbly… how your pet rock is doing?”

There was a long pause.

One of the guards tilted his head.

The other made a subtle gesture ; a curl of two fingers ; and the razor-haired weaver that made up the gate shivered, then retracted just enough to let them pass.

Steven leaned over to Dmitry .

“What did you say?”

“I think I said - We come to the city… in peace… to seek answers.” Dmitry muttered, stepping forward.

“Well… good job” Steven added, brushing past the vibrating hairs at the entryway, “you talked us into the dang mothball temple. Nicely done, Captain Rosetta Stone.”

One of the guards did follow.

Not aggressively ; just a quiet, steady patrol a few paces behind, the heavy shears across his back glinting under the filtered light. His presence wasn’t threatening, but it made one thing clear:

Don’t fuck around.

The moment Steven and Dmitry stepped through the glowing silk folds of the cocoon entrance, the atmosphere changed.

The interior was soft-lit, like daylight filtered through clouded milk-like glass. The air smelled of pressed linen, fermented honey, and blooming flora; oddly nostalgic, like a clean memory pulled from bliss times.

Inside, a small group of Sylver and woven beings moved about the space, each draped in regal, intricate robes spun with gold-thread patterns and organic iridescence. Despite the clear rank of these figures, none of them paid the humans any mind.

It was as if Steven and Dmitry were just another part of the décor ; expected guests, or perhaps simply nonthreatening anomalies.

The room stretched long like a gallery ; its walls woven, yes, but reinforced with crystalline panes that shimmered faintly when passed. Display cases lined the outer curve, subtle glyphs etched above each one in that same threaded language.

The human pair drifted towards the nearest case.

Inside: a delicately glowing sculpture, a helix of woven glass-fiber threads dancing in orbit around a black seed-like core. It didn’t seem to move… but would change depending on the angle you’d look at it.

Next: a weapon ; or maybe an instrument. A staff? A long, thin, twisted thing tipped with what looked like a woven tuning fork surrounded by a spiral of bone-lace.

Beside it: a gemstone, pulsing softly, the size of a heart. Its surface swirled with liquid starlight, but the plaque below depicted only two characters ; one of which Steven recognized from the macaroni message in his prison tray… 

“Tuk? Took? Tork? Tuhhh….? hmmm…” Dmitry scratched his head. 

“Look at this place…” Steven murmured, awe softening his voice.

“It’s like a museum and a cathedral had a baby and dressed it in a moonlight dress for a princess.”

Dmitry gave a slight nod, already mentally cataloguing each glyph, item, and impression.

The next case held something stranger ; a clear container filled with what looked like dried alien fruit, emitting some holographic images, as if it was photosynthesizing memories.

Beyond that, other display cases held:

- A woven glove that shimmered like quicksilver.
- A large, empty frame of woven branches and leaves that hummed quietly, like it was waiting for something to be placed inside.

"Check this out!" - Steven pointed at two cases side by side with elegantly knitted sweaters in patterns never seen before.

![sweater1.png](Chapter%2028%20-%20Thesselvine/sweater1.png)

![sweater2.png](Chapter%2028%20-%20Thesselvine/sweater2.png)

All around them, the hall stretched like a dream archive ; a repository of untold treasures. The occasional doorway broke the otherwise continuous flow, marked only by signs in the silk alphabet.

Steven tapped Dmitry’s shoulder.

“Reckon one of these rooms might have somethin’... familiar?” Commented Steven.

“Maybe a book. Or another weird alphabet primer?” - Dmitry responded.

“Or hell, a cafeteria. I gotta eat something good before we wake up back to prison slop lunch… ugh, I don’t even think the goons of Nhexus would eat the lentils they served us the other day.” - Steven shivered. 

Dmitry didn’t answer. He was staring at one display case in particular ; frowning.

Inside, arranged neatly on a bed of green-gold silk…

Was a single guitar string.

Made of that same alien alloy as Dallas’ guitar back on Earth.

Threaded with strange knots and tiny etched glyphs that glowed faintly as Dmitry leaned closer.

The guard behind them shifted slightly, as if to warn them not to touch.

“Steven,” Dmitry said quietly, his voice like a tightening screw,

“We’re getting closer.”

At the far end of the gallery, Steven’s pace slowed. Something was different.

“Lex… Look at that.”

“That display’s on its own little pedestal.”

Dmitry glanced up from the glowing guitar string and followed Steven’s gaze.

Indeed ; at the very end of the chamber, there was a platform, just six inches higher than the rest of the floor ; but somehow, it carried twice the gravity. Extravagant steps led up to it. Around the base, rigid guard rails of hardened silk curled like bramble ; preventing anyone from stepping too close.

The display case at its center was larger, darker, and sealed in a glasslike box reinforced with tensioned thread ; some kind of organic lockframe.

But it was what sat behind the display that caught their breath:

An eye - it was apart of the wall.

Not carved. Not projected. But living. Watching.

The cocoon building they’ve been inside was a living weaver- and this was the eye of the beast, grown seamlessly into the architecture ; a gigantic black iris surrounded by slow-pulsing membranes of shimmer-silk, blinking once every twenty seconds or so. Like a surveillance camera, this display case was guarded by the building itself.

Steven shuddered.

“I don’t like that one bit…”

“Feels like it’s peekin’ into my soul… like it knows what I did in 11th grade behind the bleachers.”

Dmitry, already ascending the short steps, approached just close enough to see the object in the case:

An amulet.

The pendant shaped like a miniature pyramid, flawlessly symmetrical, each edge woven with gold-thread strands and delicate, embedded glyphs. At its apex, a small circular capstone blinked with faint pulses of orange and violet. A gold rope chain coiled underneath it, thick but elegant ; the kind of thing made to be worn, not stored.

Steven stared at it, hands on his hips.

“That’s… probably cursed as hell.”

“Looks like somethin’ a demon salesman would give you right before sellin’ your soul for a chicken wing.”

![u8296664269_haunting_cursed_demonic_artifact_pyramid_pendant__dfb8c5ce-c440-4d9e-a090-534f2328c1c4_2.png](Chapter%2028%20-%20Thesselvine/u8296664269_haunting_cursed_demonic_artifact_pyramid_pendant__dfb8c5ce-c440-4d9e-a090-534f2328c1c4_2.png)

Dmitry leaned forward slightly, eyes falling to the plaque beneath the glass.

It was stitched, not carved. Tiny, intricate threads ; no more than a few fibers thick ; embroidered clean letters across the base.

He began to sound them out.

Slowly.

Carefully.

His accent was thick, his pronunciation rough ; but on the third repetition, the phrase clicked.

He spoke it clearly ; like someone whispering the name of a sleeping god.

And in that moment, everything changed.

The chamber reacted.

The handful of Sylver nobles, who had until now politely ignored the humans, gasped and turned sharply. The royal Weaver ; coiled in a meditative braid near the side wall ; twitched upright, threads rustling like startled windchimes.

Even the guard behind them shifted in place, his eyes widening ever so slightly beneath his mask.

“I think you impressed them,” Steven said, voice low and wide-eyed.

“Or offended their babushka. Could go either way.”

Dmitry, still in disbelief at the reaction, slowly turned to the guard behind them.

He raised his hand and formed a question mark ; or at least, the alien equivalent he remembered from one of the signs.

Then, slowly, he pointed to the plaque and repeated the phrase again ; but this time with lifted palms and a clear tilt of uncertainty in his tone.

The message was understood.

The guards didn’t move.

But a group of royals did.

Three Sylver nobles ; two in elaborate woven gowns, and one cloaked in blue-threaded ceremonial silk ; approached quietly. The royal Weaver slithered behind them with deliberate grace.

They carried a folded writing mat, and what looked like a stylus, dipped in thick, fruit-like ink ; bright and sticky like jelly.

They laid it on a low table at the corner of the room beside some old papers, sitting on the soft, silken ground surrounding it.

A lesson began.

At first: a stick ; drawn, then labeled.

Then a star.

Then a rock, a hand, a sun, and a name ; each followed by the correct threadglyph.

Steven, thrilled, sat cross-legged like a kindergarten dropout.

Dmitry sat beside him, all seriousness ; absorbing everything, mapping logic, building translation rules in his head.

The Sylver found it... fun.

A game. Teaching 2 weird aliens (humans) the basics of their language.

### **II. Fairy Tales and Nursery Rhymes**

After nearly an hour of eager but broken communication, one of the Sylver royals waved toward the guard and murmured something melodic.

Though completely alien, their language carried phonemes Dmitry could nearly place. Enunciated vowels, common consonants. Sounded like soft, calming arcane-music.

The guard bowed and returned moments later, carrying a tray with crystalized goblets and a bottle of hardened glass-like resin. The Noble Weaver poured a glass for each Sylvar and for the humans. 

Steven blinked. "Fancy." He accepted his drink, and took a sip.

"Strawberries. Honey. Mint. But also... apricots?" he muttered. "And like... mood lifting? In flavor form?"

Dmitry agreed, “We could use at least a few dozen bottles of this back in the prison.” - with a grunt and a raise of his cup.

The Sylver royals continued their explanation of the artifacts in the room:

- The heart-sized gemstone had fallen from the sky during the Night of Cinders ; a meteorite whose heat-polished edges made it sacred.
- A strange tuning-fork-shaped artifact, said to be an enchanted sewing needle once used to stitch the royal funeral shrouds of a forgotten king.
- A woven glove preserved in honor of a beloved farmer, who toiled so hard in the silkwheat fields that his dedication earned him permanent remembrance.
- A sweater designed by one of the most iconic fashion designers in Thesselvine.

Then Dmitry, curious, pointed toward one particular item ; a faint guitar string, sealed beneath silk-glass.

"What... this?" he asked in broken Sylver- while he clearly recognized what it was.

One of the royals read the plaque.

"Two alien visitors appeared in the city of Drolshan. They vanished after one evening. On their guest bed ; this string was found."

Steven’s eyes went wide.

"That’s the place I picked! That’s the city from the sign! - Dmitry that’s when we first appeared, and when we phased out of this world back to the prison - we somehow left a guitar string?!"

Dmitry nodded. He muttered the human word "guitar," trying to teach them. The Sylver blinked, confused. They did not know what a guitar was.

So Dmitry took out a piece of fruit rind and drew one. Six lines, a rounded body, a fretted neck.

The Sylver stared, fascinated. One copied the shape.

Then Dmitry pointed at the pyramid amulet display case.

"And... this?"

A hush fell over the group.

The eldest royal, his threads wrapped in hues of midnight and bone-white, stepped forward. He drew slowly on the parchment.

He wrote a nursery rhyme ; one passed to Sylver children for generations:

"Beware the Pig who walks on three,
With fur of rot and eyes that see,
He'll grant you gold, he'll grant you fame,
But curse your kin and burn your name.

He speaks of luck, he sings of wealth,
He trades your soul for someone else's health.
So take the charm and wear it proud,
And watch your loved ones burn without sound."

When the rhyme was read aloud ; the royals chuckled.

"Children's tale. An old boogeyman myth, a legend." one of them said through half-learned Earth words.

But Dmitry and Steven... did not laugh.

They were dead silent, eyes fixed on the parchment.

Because on the corner of the page, drawn whimsically by a playful royal hand, was a small cartoon pig...

...with three legs.

And holes for eyes.

And horns that weren’t quite symmetrical.

Steven's voice was barely above a whisper:

"Lex... that’s the description of the thing Dallas and Haoyu said they saw in their dreams on Nhexus and Ferron."

Dmitry responded;
”The one… that told them to get out of its realm…”

One of the Sylver royals froze mid-step. Their long, glistening ears twitched, and they turned sharply ; pupils wide with an emotion that could only be described as ancestral fear.

“Did you say…” the royal asked in their melodic voice, though the pitch trembled slightly, “…the Pig?”

Dmitry nodded slowly, choosing his words with the caution of a man handling explosives.

“We haven’t seen it ourselves,” he said, voice rough. “But we know two people who have. Dallas… and Commander Zhang.”

The words hit the room like a silent earthquake.

The royals paled ; if their already pale, luminous skin could go any lighter. They whispered frantically among themselves in woven syllables, their soft music now a sharp, urgent melody. One waved to the guard. Another clutched their chest.

Within moments, they packed up their belongings and they were gone.

Every one of them ; the royals, the aides, even the hardened guard with his bone-shears ; had fled the chamber in hurried silence, like a ritual warning had been triggered.

Dmitry and Steven stood alone, in the heart of a sacred place, under the gaze of something they couldn’t yet name.

They looked at each other.

They turned slowly ; almost unwillingly ; and walked toward the platform at the far end of the hall.

The amulet still sat in its glass case. A pyramid shape, affixed to a thick golden chain. It glowed faintly, as if alive. As if watching them.

The security eye above it… was different.

It was a whole face now.

A face of rot, of disease, slack and sagging, its skin torn like old cloth, its snout dripping bile, with fangs and tusks of nightmares.

It was the face of a Pig ; or something that had once resembled one ; staring down from the wall with lifeless, cratered sockets of pure black void where eyes should be.

From it’s mouth, dripping pus filled saliva, pooling onto the glass of the display case sheltering the amulet.

A voice ; seeped into the room like black oil through silk:

“Would you like to make a deal?”

Dmitry’s breath caught.

Steven’s body locked.

The air felt thick, sticky, like wading through apathetic molasses. Every heartbeat was heavier. The presence of the Pig was not just visual. It was felt in the marrow.

Then the voice came again, harsher now, more directed:

“Why don’t you turn around… and look at what you’ve done to your Commander?”

Neither of them wanted to.

But their bodies moved ; unwillingly - as if the pig had a controller connected to them.

They turned.

And in the center of the glowing cocoon ; where once there had been only smooth woven floor ; now stood a prison.

A ribcage. Curved, yellowed, and fossilized. Its bones arched high above the floor like the bars of an organic jail cell.

Inside, curled into himself like a dying star, was Haoyu Zhang.

His body trembled. His head buried in his knees. His arms clutched tight around his legs. His skin ; pale, waxen. His back ; heaving with silent sobs. A man reduced to the embryo of grief.

“Haoyu…” Steven croaked, barely able to form the word.

It came out like rust off a broken hinge.

But the Pig was not finished.

Its voice, once a whisper, now exploded with wrathful thunder, rattling the very strands of the chamber’s walls:

“You opened the door in Nhexus.”

“You came to play a game in my realm.”

“And your Commander… has lost.”

Suddenly, the room dimmed. The cocoon glowed no longer. Threads on the walls receded, shrinking into darkness. The plaque under the amulet sizzled and turned black.

A shape began to emerge from the shadows at the far end of the hall.

It crawled.

A massive three-legged beast, oozing, pulsing, its flesh bubbled with blisters the size of pumpkins, some of them weeping pus. One leg was cracked down the middle, dragging broken bone. One arm clawed the ground; the other dragged a massive chunk of fused organic metal, part axe, part limb, part… who knows.

The stench hit them a second later.

A mixture of rotting meat, burnt hair, and wet dog.

It reached the ribcage.

It towered above Haoyu. And the Pig’s voice returned ; now laced with sadistic sarcasm.

“Haoyu… do I need to teach you proper manners?”

“Look at my guests.”

Haoyu moved.

Just barely.

His spine curled tighter first ; as if trying to fold further into himself. But something forced him up. A whisper? A command?

He looked up.

And Steven screamed - Dmitrys face went into utter shock 

Haoyu’s face was no longer human. His skin was pale and veiny, stretched unnaturally over cheekbones that jutted like blades. His mouth was stretched into a comically large smile. His eyes…

His eyes were black holes, just like the Pig’s.

His expression ; empty. As though all emotion had been cauterized.

Dmitry stumbled back and vomited on the floor, clutching his chest like the dream itself was suffocating him.

The Pig’s face split into a grotesque grin, torn skin peeling at the corners like burnt parchment.

“You have seen far too much for the mortal eye.”

A beat.

A pause.

And then the final command - with raging anger and impending doom

“**Now get out of my realm**.”

The sound of a harsh bell started blaring in the cocoon - as all went black…

Steven and Dmitry bolted upright in their prison beds, gasping, drenched in sweat. Chests heaving. Hands shaking.

The morning bell blared through the jail.

Breakfast trays would soon be slammed against bars.

But neither of them heard it.

Because in their minds, one image still burned:

Haoyu’s black eyes, staring through them.

And somewhere far away ; on another world, in another realm ; something was stirring.
