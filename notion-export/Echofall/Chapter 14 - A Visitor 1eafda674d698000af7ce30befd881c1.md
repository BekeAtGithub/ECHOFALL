# Chapter 14 - A Visitor

### I. The Hour of Arrival

**2535**

Three years passed.

Every satellite had tracked their approach.

Nhexus exploration project has been completely halted, with full attention directed towards the invasion. 

Every sensor had screamed the same truth.

The Oc’Xari swarm, what had once been a handful of curious watchers had grown into a cloud of movement so dense it dwarfed anything the solar system had ever seen.

Each one a living enigma of alien motion, folding through magnetic wakes and dark matter tethers.

And now, they had just passed Mars.

Projected arrival to Earth’s orbit: One hour.

There was an eerie global stillness.

The calm before the unknown.

The hush before the first real contact.

Skies were clear. Cities were still.

Every military weapon pointed at the sky.

People stood on rooftops, beaches, deserts, ruins.

Waiting.

Except in Saskatchewan.

At Dallas Red’s ranch, the fire pit crackled.

Kids laughed around hay bales.

An old cassette deck played blues rock through a speaker duct-taped to a wheelbarrow. The song skipped and fuzzed for a few beats.

Nobody looked up.

“That’s just the satellites acting weird again,” one man said, tipping back a mason jar of ol’ bathtub whiskey.

Dallas strummed his guitar; an off-tune, soulful waltz.

The kids clapped.

The moms sang along.

No one packed a bag.

No one loaded a weapon.

### II. Arrival in Silence

An hour passed.

Then another half hour.

The world, so long frenzied, now held its breath too long.

In every command center, bunker, radio tower and emergency broadcast station… nothing moved.

Eyes locked to the sky.

To screens.

To silence.

Where were they?

Had they stopped?

Changed course?

Turned back?

“They should be here.”

“They *are* here.”

“So where the hell are they?”

Then maybe about 20 minutes later… it happened.

At exactly 5:42 p.m. UTC, a massive shadow rolled across the sky.

It didn’t come with noise.

Or fire.

Or fury.

Just a slow, oppressive dimming; 

As if a gigantic, silent hand passed between Earth and the sun.

Birds fell quiet.

Winds stopped.

For about ten seconds, the world was bathed in an unnatural gray haze.

And then… it faded. It was gone.

The sun returned.

The clouds were normal.

Birds began chirping away.

It was like nothing happened?

Military bases scrambled.

Ground radars spun wildly.

Comms channels buzzed like beehives without queens.

“Did anyone see anything?”

“Was it just a cloudbank?”

“Are they cloaked?”

“Are they *gone*?”

The Echofall control center went into red lockdown.

All systems reported the same thing:

THEY ARE HERE.

But nobody could see them.

Satellites shrieked with error flags.

Thermal arrays lit up like Christmas grids.

Quantum-lattice scanners showed distortions in every atmospheric layer.

And the AI defense systems?

They were screaming.

“Presence detected in all hemispheres.”

“Spatial irregularities exceed prediction models.”

“Oc’Xari biomass signature confirmed; surrounding all major landmasses.”

Monitoring systems were detecting and reporting hundreds of thousands of detected entities within our atmosphere, littering the entire planet.

But to the human eye?

Nothing.

No ships.

No shapes.

No voices.

Just a world like it was before.

What Earth didn’t know; 

The Oc’Xari had melted into the biosphere.

Blending seamlessly into wind patterns, soil frequencies, tree-root EM lattices.

Merging with data cables.

Slipping into memory.

And now…

They were everywhere.

Watching.

And Earth had no idea…

### IV. Return to Normal?

A month passed.

And slowly; painfully; the world began to normalize.

The skies were still blue.

Cities buzzed again.

Phones chirped with gossip instead of evacuation warnings.

The Oc’Xari were nowhere.

At least, not visibly.

Not audibly.

No ships. No weapons. No signs.

So people did what humans always do when the unexplainable overstays its welcome:

They forgot.

Governments began to crumble under scrutiny.

Whistleblowers leaked classified recordings.

Budget sheets emerged.

The global taxation spikes? The mass mobilization? The emergency powers granted to world leaders?

All of it had been exploited.

All the events in the last couple decades including the Echofall Project - was labeled as a fake hoax, setup as a narrative to control people, tax the hell out of the planet and test human behavior reactions under a possible alien invasion as if it was a fire drill.

Oligarchs expanded their holdings.

Defense contractors posted record profits.

Some cities never received the defense infrastructure they were promised.

The trials began.

Rioters jailed.

Politicians interrogated.

The public turned vicious.

And at the center of the fury was the **Echofall commander**.

“You lied.”

“You panicked the world for funding.”

“There were no aliens.”

His team; once composed of the world’s best minds; now found themselves banished from networks.

Their credentials questioned.

Their findings labeled as AI-induced hallucinations causing mass hysteria.

The AI Defense Systems still alarming and generating thousands of alerts a minute about foreign entities detected all over earth were shut off.

Dismissed as faulty.

“They’re broken.”

“They’re still pinging ghosts.”

“It’s a software bug.”

The engineers protested.

The scientists screamed.

They poured over their equations, rewrote their models, reverse-engineered signal profiles.

But their voices were drowned out by laughter.

By dismissals.

By normalcy.

And no one…

No one asked about Nhexus.

The EON-7b Echofall rover?

Still active.

Still sending data.

Fossils of ancient life. Flesh Buildings. Bone Pyramids. Alien Entity Shadows.

But nobody cared anymore, the network feeds were buried.

The servers were now maintained by interns who didn’t even know what the project was.

Most of the public now believed it was all fake. The meteor, the rover, Nhexus and the invasion.

It had become a myth.

A punchline.

"Aliens? Like the Slop Planet? Please."
