# Chapter 38 - Survival

### **I. The Avaris - The Kavariin - The Skybourne Traders**

The Oc’Xari; the cosmic spyware; knew the deal had taken place.

In the moment Dmitry chose to side with the Pig, something ancient and instinctual within the Oc’Xari was triggered: a failsafe panic, the echo of their creators’ last command; survive at all costs.

And so they duplicated.

Not just replication… but supercharged, exponential propagation.

Their threads split like viral fibers, firing in all directions across the galaxy in numbers never before recorded; faster than light, faster than time could witness. They spread themselves through nebulae, black hole coronas, red giant atmospheres, and dormant asteroid clusters in desperate search for a way out.

And in this desperate, last-ditch act; mirroring the reckless hope of the LUCA Canon eons ago; they finally touched something they had never encountered before.

An ancient alien civilization, as old as the first pulses of sentient thought. As old, perhaps, as the Ancients themselves who built the LUCA seed project. But unlike the LUCA seed children, Avaris was untouched. Pure. Original.

The Pig had once spoken of Kavariin to Dmitry, almost reverently.

“I have never interfered with them,” he had said.

“They play by the rules. Their song is true. Their life is real.”

The Avaris had never known war. Never known invasion. Never known there was other life in the universe.

Never met the Pig.

The Oc’Xari, in their blind terror, their swarming chaos, reached Kavariin.

And even there, with all their advancement, the Avaris detected them instantly.

They didn’t respond with lockdowns or military escalations.

There were no sky-taxes.

No fear propaganda.

No political theater-not like on Earth.

Instead, there was simply a signal.

A shared harmonic sent across the planet.

“There is an essence in the sky.

A shadow in the data wind.

Prepare for Protocol Aelion.”

Satellites dimmed. Education domes closed their wings. Cultural sanctuaries paused their performances. The planet folded inwards, gracefully withdrawing from the cosmos.

Dreamers awoke breathless. The skies lost their shimmer. Infants cried for the first time without sound.

A rot was felt in the rhythm of the world.

The Pig had arrived.

For the first time in eternity, the Pig stood; unwelcome, uninvited; on the doorstep of a world that had never broken a rule.

But the Oc’Xari had brought him there.

And he was furious.

“An infection has arrived in your domain,” his voice hissed from the upper thermals, rippling like mold across glass.

The Avaris did not panic.

They formed a council.

They listened.

And then asked, with no fear in their breath:

“What do you want, stranger?”

The Pig snarled.

“I want to cleanse what your world has never known: corruption.”

And somewhere, across the void, on a cold snow-choked road in Canada, Dmitry and Steven walked onward; unaware that their deal had triggered a new reckoning in a part of the universe that had never known darkness.

### **II. Golden**

Four days left.

Dmitry and Steven trudged forward along the shoulder of the Trans-Canada Highway, snow crunching under their high-tech boots, bags of gear dragging behind them like a grave they refused to dig. Their breath came in sharp bursts, crystallizing instantly in the frigid air.

A metal sign loomed through the whiteout.

Welcome to Golden.

Calgary – 264km

Steven stopped. His walking stick clattered from his numb fingers.

“What the Hell is so Golden about this place? Huh? We only came 140 kilometers?”

He panted like a dog, shoulders sagging under the weight of exhaustion. Snow flaked off his sleeves, steam rising from the heat vents in his jacket.

Dmitry stood silent.

The wind whistled between them.

He didn’t answer.

He couldn’t.

For the first time since they made the deal... he doubted they would make it.

<Steven on the left, Dmitry on the right… Do they look exactly how you imagined? No? Great!>

**Golden, BC.**

They staggered into town, two frostbitten ghosts dragging bags buried in snow and survival gear. The sight was absurd: two men looking like corporate-sponsored adventurers on the edge of collapse, gear worth more than the entire town block, slushing through the downtown strip toward the only lit-up storefront.

“Bluebird Café.”

They barreled in, door jingling. The barista, an attractive bubbly girl in her twenties, startled at first; then relaxed, seeing the fancy Archon logos on their suits.

Expensive. Corporate. Sponsored.

She assumed they were rich weirdos on a record-breaking arctic trek.

“Wow,” she grinned, “you guys camping out for science or TikTok?”

They nodded vaguely, snow melting off their hoods, puddling at their feet. The café was warm; too warm; the sudden contrast made Steven’s knees weak. He collapsed into a chair as Dmitry leaned against the counter.

“Phone dead,” Steven rasped. “You got a charger?”

“Sure thing,” she chirped. “iOS or ‘Droid?”

“Yes.” said Steven.

She laughed and disappeared behind the counter. A few minutes later, she returned with two steaming mugs of something nostalgic and beautiful. Lattes with the aesthetic leaf drawn into the foam top.

“That’ll cure your frostbite,” she winked.

On the wall behind her, a TV murmured low. Local weather report. Dmitry glanced at it, zoned out, half-listening. He caught something.

“…storm breaking east of Banff… conditions improving toward Calgary…”

He perked up.

“Banff?” he asked. “Where’s that?”

She blinked, confused. “You don’t know Banff?”

Steven leaned in, arms cradling his coffee like a newborn. “Never heard of her. Is she hot?”

“It’s like… the biggest tourist spot in the country.”

“We found Nhexus across the galaxy,” Dmitry muttered. “But not Banff on our own planet.”

They chuckled. Quietly. Weakly.

<The barista at the Bluebird Cafe, Golden BC>

After some more small talk, and a few deflections about where they were from and where they were going, they took their mugs to the far back corner. The café’s warm glow didn’t quite reach there ; perfect for scheming.

Dmitry laid it out:

“We’ve walked 140 kilometers in two days. Banff’s another 140. The storm breaks after Banff ; she said it’s clear to Calgary and beyond.”

Steven nodded. “We’ve got four days until the Pig comes to collect.”

“So we walk to Banff. Make it in four days.”

“Then what?”

“We steal another car. Rip it to Swift Current. That’s about 700 kilometers ; doable in one day if the roads are clear.”

Steven thought for a moment.

“So… we walk to Banff. In a blizzard. Across another snow obliterated highway, then Grand Theft Auto across the prairie.”

Dmitry sipped his coffee. “It’s a plan.”

“That’s not a plan,” Steven muttered. “That’s a fever dream in a gas station bathroom.”

“Worked so far.”

They readied their gear, left a fat tip on the counter with stolen drug lord cash; and headed out through the parkade exit behind the café.

They noticed toboggans outside a gas station completely snowed in.

“The station looks closed, there’s nobody here to buy the sleds from…” Steven said.

“We can borrow these too.” Dmitry remarked as he started fixing his gear onto one of the toboggans.

They stepped back onto the highway, gear strapped down onto toboggans pulled behind them, eyes set forward.

“Banff, here we come,” Steven muttered.

And with that, they disappeared once more into the white inferno of Canada’s wilderness.

### **III. Banff**

**4 Days Remain**

The highway was little more than a suggestion now; buried beneath drifts that swallowed boots, sled tracks, and willpower alike. The Great Canadian Wilderness towered around them in every direction: jagged tree lines, brittle frozen pines, sheer cliffs slick with icicles like teeth, and valleys crusted in white silence. Mountains loomed on either side, their slopes gouged with old avalanche scars.

Every few kilometers, the wind would rise like a living hydra; damn near creating snow tornados, howling down the pass, screaming through branches, and punching straight through their breath-warmed masks. Visibility dropped to nothing, and they had to follow utility poles and tree blazes just to confirm they were still beside the road.

Each step was a test. Each rest stop was fleeting. They rationed food, shared heat packs, and took turns pulling the sleds; like oxen, silent and resigned.

The first night, they found shelter beneath a shattered old billboard; half a metal frame protruding from the snow, offering just enough break from the wind. They pitched the tent, climbed inside, and ate dry protein rations in silence, listening to the storm tear through the valley like a feral thing.

**3 Days Remain**

The next day was more of the same: wind, ice, frostbite threats, and aching joints. They passed long-frozen rivers, entire sections of forest flattened by past slides, and once… a buried highway sign sticking just barely out of the snow: "Welcome to Yoho National Park."

Just past the buried Yoho sign, they stumbled onto another one ; this one half-tipped over and crusted in frost, but still legible:

“Banff ; 1 km”

Steven perked up instantly.

“Dude. One kilometer? We’re there!”

Dmitry’s eyebrows actually rose for the first time in hours. He pulled off a glove, wiped at the sign with his bare hand, and confirmed it.

“It says Banff. Finally…”

Their pace quickened. The road bent, sloped down into a wide glacial stretch. Trees opened. The wind let up.

But what they saw next wasn’t a town. It was a trailhead kiosk, a snowed-in parking lot, and another sign:

**“Welcome to Banff National Park”**

Underneath it read; “Banff Town Center - 47km”

Dmitry stopped - perplexed

Steven squinted.

“Wait… it’s just the park?”

They looked around ; nothing but wilderness, mountains, and white. Banff the *city* was still miles off, probably on the far edge of this vast, frozen reserve.

“Of course,” Dmitry muttered. “Of course there’s a park and a city.”

Steven groaned.

“We’re gonna die in a park, Lex.”

Dmitry rolled his shoulders and gripped the sled harness tighter.

“Not today.”

And they trudged on.

Dmitry muttered something in Russian.

Steven just grunted.

The sun never really showed; just a dim smear of light overhead. Time passed in *hours of white and grey*.

That night, the tent pitched once more. The gear unpacked. They crawled into their sleeping bags, breathing hard, too tired to speak.

**2 Days Remain**

They woke up the following morning, muscles heavy, hungry… the food rations sucked. Maybe a beer would be nice.

Another day of walking through an endless blizzard, trudging through thick snow.

“Dmitry, we have to leave one of the sleds… I can’t handle carrying all shit shit anymore.”

They sat down on a block of frozen ice, evaluating what gear they really needed for the next couple days, leaving more than half of it in the snow bank. Continuing on with just one toboggan with a much smaller sack, just the tents, some food and a few pairs of dry socks, along with their weapons. 

Another nightfall came. Camp deployed, sleep hit. Then the dreams came.
