# Chapter 45 - Option 3

# I. The Third Choice - Give the Artifact to the Avaris

They slowly crept in their SUV driving a lap around the police station, scoping out the entrances. A squat, concrete building wedged between a dental office and a run-down sandwich shop. Only a single cruiser sat out front, rimmed in frost, clearly untouched for hours.

They then pulled over into a side alleyway.
From the dark of their stolen SUV, Steven leaned forward, peering through the windshield.

"I see one guy inside. He's on the couch… I think he's sleepin'. Watchin' some shitty TV show."

**The Plan**

Dmitry pulled out a folded napkin from the gas station and drew a crude layout of the station, based on their drive-by recon.

"There's a side entrance here, with a door knob." he pointed. "Looks pretty secluded. I'll go in through there. You wait at the back door, there is no door knob, so you won't be able to break in- so I'll open the door from inside to let you in."

Steven studied the napkin, then nodded.

"Alright. So I just wait for you to open the back door?"

"Yeah. Give me two minutes. I'll get past him, then let you in. Easy."

Steven took a long breath.

"Okay."

They opened the doors and stepped into the freezing night.

The wind had picked up. Their breath curled out in steam.

The town slept, quiet as a corpse.

And the clock was ticking.

**The Break-In**

Steven positioned himself near the back of the building, crouched low by a window where he could see inside. The sleeping police officer was sprawled on a worn couch in the front room, bathed in the flickering blue light of a late-night infomercial.  
He waited, watching for Dmitry to come let him in.

Dmitry moved silently to the side entrance. He tested the door ; unlocked. Small-town trust. He slipped inside.

The hallway was dim, lit only by a single buzzing fluorescent light. Dmitry moved like a shadow, boots silent on the tile floor. He could hear the faint drone of the TV from the front room.

Through the window, Steven watched Dmitry creep past the sleeping officer. The man didn't stir. His chest rose and fell in steady rhythm, one arm draped over his face.

*Good,* Steven thought. *Now come let me in.*

But Dmitry didn't head toward the back door.

Instead, he turned down a different hallway ; away from Steven, deeper into the station.

Steven's eyes narrowed. *What the hell is he doing?*

He couldn't see where Dmitry went. The angle was wrong. The hallway Dmitry took was out of sight from the window.

*Maybe there's another route to the back door,* Steven thought. *Just give him a minute.*

But then the cop stirred.

His eyes snapped open. He sat up, alert, like he'd heard something. He grabbed a shotgun leaning against the wall and stood, moving quickly down the same hallway Dmitry had gone.

Steven's heart pounded. *Shit. Dmitry's about to get caught.*

He waited for the sound of shouting. Gunfire. Something.

But nothing came.

The cop disappeared down the hallway, shotgun raised.

Steven pressed his face closer to the glass, trying to see. But he couldn't. The armory was somewhere down that hall, completely out of view.

Seconds passed.

Then minutes...

Then the cop reappeared.

Slowly. Confused.

He walked back into the front room, shotgun still in hand, looking around like he'd just seen a ghost. He glanced down the hallway again, then back at the room, his face pale.

He muttered something under his breath ; "What the hell…" ; shaking his head. He looked genuinely spooked.

The cop set the shotgun back against the wall and sat down on the couch, rubbing his face with both hands. He kept glancing back at the hallway, like he expected something to jump out at him.

Steven watched, bewildered. *Where the hell is Dmitry? Did he hide? Did he get out another way?*

The cop sat there for a long moment, staring at nothing. His hands were shaking slightly. He kept glancing back at the hallway, then at the room, like he was trying to convince himself he hadn't just seen what he thought he saw.

Then he glanced toward the window.

And saw Steven.

The cop jumped, nearly falling off the couch. His hand went to his chest, eyes wide, like he'd just had a heart attack.

"Jesus Christ!" he yelped.

Steven froze.

The cop stared at him for a long moment, breathing hard, then took a deep breath, collecting himself. He stood, walked to the back door, and opened it.

"Hello, citizen," the cop said, his voice shaky. "Can I… can I help you?"

Steven stood there, completely flabbergasted. He'd just watched the cop chase after Dmitry with a shotgun, come back looking like he'd seen a ghost, and now he was acting like nothing happened.

"Uh…" Steven stammered. "No. I was just… out for a walk."

The cop looked him up and down, then glanced out at the snowy street, then back at Steven, like he was trying to figure out if Steven was real or another hallucination or ghost.

"Alright. Well… be careful. The roads are slippery."

"Yeah. Thanks."

The cop nodded slowly, then closed the door. Steven could hear him lock it from the inside.

Steven stood there for a moment, staring at the closed door.

*What the fuck just happened?*

He turned and walked back to the SUV, his mind racing.

He climbed into the driver's seat and sat there, hands on the wheel, staring at the police station.

*Where the hell is Dmitry?*

*Did he get caught? Did he escape out another exit? Did the cop arrest him and I just didn't see it?*

None of it made sense.

Steven sat there in the freezing SUV, engine idling, heater humming.

Alone.

Waiting for an answer that would never come.

### Inside the Armory - Moments Earlier

Dmitry had slipped into the armory the moment he entered the station. He knew exactly where he was going. He'd made his choice.

He heard the cop stir behind him. Heard the footsteps. Heard the shotgun being grabbed.

No time.

He found the guitar case ; black, old, sitting on a shelf like it had been waiting for him. It hummed with energy, vibrating slightly. He unlatched it with trembling hands.

Inside, the instrument gleamed with an otherworldly sheen, its strings humming with a frequency that made his teeth ache.

Dmitry pulled out the Avaris artifact from his jacket, faintly pulsing with light.

The cop's footsteps were pounding down the hallway now. Getting closer.

Dmitry held the artifact over the sound hole.

*I'm sorry, Steven.*

He dropped it in.

For a moment, nothing happened.

Just silence.

Dmitry now overwhelmed with anxiety...
"Fuck, what now? Please work, please work..."

Then-

A pulse of energy erupted from the sound hole. A blinding cascade of light wrapped around Dmitry like liquid glass. The walls of the armory bent inward, reality folding like wet paper.

Dmitry felt his body dissolve ; not painfully, but completely. Every atom unraveling, reforming, being pulled through a tunnel of impossible geometry.

The cop burst through the armory door, shotgun raised.

Empty.

Nobody there.

He stood in the doorway, breathing hard, scanning the room. Shelves. Boxes. Weapons. Locked cabinets. But no intruder.

He'd *seen* someone run in here. He was *sure* of it.

But the room was empty.

The police officer lowered the shotgun, his hands shaking. His eyes darted around the room, checking corners, behind shelves, under tables.

Nothing.

"What the hell…" he muttered, his voice barely a whisper.

He backed out slowly, his heart pounding. He glanced back one more time, then hurried back to the front room.

*I saw someone. I know I did. But there's nobody there.*

The station was haunted. Had to be.

He sat back down on the couch, trying to calm his breathing, trying to convince himself he'd just been dreaming.

Then he saw Steven's face in the window.

And nearly had a heart attack.

### III. Arrival on Kavariin

**Kavariin - The Avaris Homeworld**

Dmitry gasped, stumbling forward onto smooth, polished stone.

He was no longer in Saskatchewan.

He was standing in the same chamber from the dream ; the obsidian-glass table, the radiant architecture.

The Avaris diplomat stood before him, towering and regal. Their wide, ancient eyes blinked slowly.

"You chose wisely, Dmitry Alexeyev."

Dmitry collapsed to his knees, still clutching the guitar. His voice cracked.

"Steven… is he... is the pig going to kill him, because of me?"

The Avaris stepped forward, their talons clicking softly on the floor.

"We are unsure. However, his sacrifice was a necessary risk which won't be forgotten."

From the shadows, the Oc'Xari emerged ; small, quiet, its mirrored eyes reflecting Dmitry's grief.

"We are sorry for your choice in betrayal." it said through the translation device. "But you have chosen the path of peace."

Dmitry looked up, tears streaming down his face.

"What happens now?"

The Avaris gestured to the guitar, which now sat on the table, the artifact embedded in its sound hole glowing faintly.

"We have to contain the guitar, in our energy trap chamber. Then, we wait. The Pig will come for it. And when it does, we will be ready."

**The Trap**

The Avaris had prepared for this moment.

The energy trap chamber ; it was a containment field. The walls hummed with energy, invisible threads of force that could bind even something as ancient and formless as the Pig.

Dmitry was given a small room to rest ; clean, warm, with a window overlooking the vast cities of Kavariin. He couldn't sleep. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Steven's face.

Hours passed.
Then days.
The Pig did not come.

Meanwhile, back on Earth, Commander Haoyu Zhang was executed at Mississippi Supermax on the seventh day, seven years ago, just as the Pig had promised. His family mourned. The media called him a traitor. History would not be kind to him.

**One Week Later**

Dmitry woke up in a comfy alien bed to the soft hum of the city outside his window, getting up slowly.

His quarters were a condo of some park resort. Floor 5 of a structure that complemented its surroundings.

He walked to the window.
The view took his breath away every single morning.

The Avaris had an appreciation for beauty. They placed Dmitry's in a badlands landscape that was famous for hiking, climbing and Gliding, they wanted to show him some of the finer areas of Kavariin. 

![Dmitry's quarters on Kavariin](option3dmitry-alienhouse.png)

Dmitry exhaled slowly, his breath fogging the glass for just a moment before the window adjusted its temperature to match his presence.

He turned away from the view and walked to the small alcove that served as his kitchen.

The Avaris had tried to accommodate him. They'd studied human biology, human needs. They would bring him meals.
On the counter sat a plate of what looked like pork ribs, fruits and rice. They looked a little different that on Earth, but it was nutritionally complete, they'd assured him. Protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals. Everything a human needed.

It tasted different too, but really good.
The Avaris were known for chef culture or art, expression and exploration. 

He saw a little note beside it, explaining the ribs are lab grown synthesized from algae and fungal proteins. 

"How the hyeck did they get the bones so realistic?"
Dmitry was impressed.

He thought of Steven.
The way Dmitry betrayed him. The confusion he must have felt.
"Dmitry… what are you doing?"
"I hope Steven is okay."
Dmitry closed his eyes, gripping the eating utensil in his hand.

**Two Weeks Later**

The artifact chamber sat empty. But eventually, the lure worked... the air thickened, curdled, and the Pig materialized ; massive, grotesque, its flesh slick and rotting, its eyes burning with ancient rage.

"You DARE-"

The containment field activated.

Threads of energy snapped around the Pig like chains, pulling it down, binding it to the artifact. It roared, thrashing, its form rippling and distorting.

"YOU THINK YOU CAN HOLD ME?!"

The Avaris diplomat stepped forward, calm and unwavering.

"We do not seek to destroy you. Only to contain you. You are not a god. You are a wound in the fabric of existence. And wounds can be healed."

The Pig snarled, thrashing against the chains. Its form bulged and twisted, testing the limits of the containment.

The field held. Barely.

But it was clear this was not a permanent solution. The Pig was too ancient, too powerful. The containment would need constant reinforcement, constant vigilance.

It would take years to fully bind it.

### **IV. The Alliance**

**Year 1 - The Beginning**

With the Pig partially contained, the Avaris, the Oc'Xari, and humanity began to communicate.

Dmitry became the ambassador ; the bridge between three civilizations. He was given access to technology beyond comprehension, knowledge that reshaped his understanding of the universe.

The Oc'Xari shared their archives ; millennia of observation, data on countless worlds, insights into biology and consciousness.

The Avaris offered their wisdom ; philosophy, engineering, art.

And humanity? Humanity brought something unexpected.

**Hope.**

The Avaris had lived so long they had forgotten how to dream. The Oc'Xari had observed so much they had forgotten how to feel.

But humans ; messy, chaotic, beautiful humans ; they still believed in tomorrow.

**Year 5 - Tampa Beach**

Steven had made it back.

It hadn't been easy. After that night in Saskatchewan, he drove the stolen SUV down to Estevan SK, where there was a decent sized trailyard, he hopped in to hide between crates on a freight train, and slowly made his way south, back into the United States. No one was looking for him anymore. The police station incident was nothing more than a spooked cop who swore he'd seen a ghost.

Steven got his old job back at the drone delivery company. Same VR headset. Same 12-hour shifts. Same cramped apartment.

He couldn't stop thinking about that night. About Dmitry. About where he'd gone.

*Did he teleport to the Avaris? Did he trap the Pig? Is he even alive? The Pig said he'd kill me, but I'm still alive... so Dmitry must be out there fighting the Pig across the stars.*

One afternoon, Steven was walking along Tampa Beach, his (toes) puppies dipped in the sand, watching the waves roll in. The sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink.
He'd just finished a shift and needed to clear his head.

Then a voice called out behind him.

"Steven Young."

Steven froze. He turned slowly.

A man stood there. Middle-aged. Dark skin. Well-dressed in a tropical linen suit, despite the heat. 

"Who the hell are you?" asked Steven.

The man smiled.
"My name is Bihiniwa Okonkwo. I represent the Democratic Republic of the Congo."

Steven's eyes narrowed.

"The Congo? What the hell does the Congo want with me?"

Bihiniwa stepped closer, hands in his pockets, casual.

"It wasn't easy to find you, Steven. You've been… elusive."

"Yeah, well, I like to keep a low profile."

Bihiniwa nodded.

"I understand. You've been through a lot. The Echofall mission. The prison. The escape. Saskatchewan."

Steven's jaw tightened.

"How do you know about Saskatchewan?"

"We've been watching. Monitoring. The world is more connected than you think. We know there was a certain guitar there, and it's not there anymore."

Steven took a step back.

"What do you want?"

Bihiniwa pulled out a business card and held it out.

"Do you know where Dmitry Alexeyev is?"

Steven stared at the card, then at Bihiniwa.

"I don't know."

"You don't know? Or you won't say?"

"I don't know know." Steven repeated. 

"And what about the guitar? Do you know where that is?"

"I'm not sure. I don't know." answered Steven, his voice firm this time.

Bihiniwa studied him for a long moment, then nodded slowly.

"I believe you."

He extended the card again.

"If you ever find him, or if he contacts you, give me a call. We could use someone like him. Someone like you."

Steven took the card, glanced at it, then shoved it in his pocket.

"Yeah. Sure."

Bihiniwa smiled.

"Enjoy the beach, Steven."

He turned and walked away, disappearing into the crowd of tourists and beachgoers.

Steven stood there for a moment, staring at the ocean.

*Dmitry… where the hell are you?*

He thought about it. The Avaris. The teleportation. The dream.

*He must have chose option 3. He's with the Avaris. He has to be.*

Steven didn't know.

And he never would.

He pulled out the business card, looked at it one more time, then tossed it into a nearby trash can.

He wasn't going to call. Even if he found Dmitry, he wouldn't.

Dmitry had made his choice. Steven had made his.

He walked back to his apartment, back to his life, back to the monotony of drone deliveries and VR headsets.

And he lived.

For the rest of his days, Steven Young lived a quiet life in Florida. He made some investments and bought a house by a lake in Ocala. 
He got married, had kids, got a dog, went hunting and fishing. 

And sometimes, late at night, he'd look up at the stars and imagine which one of them was Dmitry.

*Did we save the world?*

He never got an answer.

**Year 10 - First Contact with Earth**

Dallas Red, still imprisoned in a government blacksite, grew old and frail. The years of isolation, the experiments, the interrogations ; they had broken his body. He died quietly in his cell, alone, forgotten by the world he had tried to warn.

The Avaris sent a delegation to Earth.
The world reacted with fear, then wonder, then cautious optimism.
It took many decades to build trust. Especially after the initial Nhexus and Oc'Xari incidents, the world was skeptical of extraterrestrial contact.

**Year 50 - The Golden Age**

Humanity joined the galactic community and started sharing technology.

In the coming centuries, cities would be built on Mars, Europa, Titan. Humans would walk on worlds they had only dreamed of.

The Oc'Xari taught them to see the universe not as a place to conquer, but to understand.

The Avaris taught them to build not just with metal and stone, but with intention and beauty.

And together, they thrived.

Dmitry lived to see it all. He was in his nineties now, his body failing despite the best medicine the Avaris could offer.

He knew his time was coming.

**Year 52 - The Upload**

Dmitry lay in a medical chamber on Kavariin, his breathing shallow, his heart weak.

The Avaris diplomat stood beside him, their feathers dimmed with sorrow.

"We can preserve you," they said. "Not your body. But your mind. Your consciousness. Your memories. We can upload you into our archives. You would live on, as data, as thought, as legacy."

Dmitry looked at the ceiling, thinking of Steven. Of Haoyu. Of Dallas.

"Will I still be me?"

"You will be a version of you. A reflection. An echo. A Dmitry Ai model."

He smiled weakly.

"An echo. Like the rover. Like the fall."

"Yes."

"Do it."

And so, Dmitry Alexeyev ; janitor, engineer, ambassador, survivor ; was uploaded into the Avaris AI database as it's own model.

His body was laid to rest beside a monument to Steven, Haoyu, and Dallas.

But his mind lived on.

**Year 100 - The Expansion**

The alliance grew.

Other LUCA-born species were discovered ; not destroyed, but welcomed.

The Pig remained partially contained, its rage slowly being worn down by the relentless energy of the containment field. It would take centuries more to fully bind it.

The universe, it seemed, was healing.

**Year 300 - The Final Binding**

After nearly three centuries of constant reinforcement, the Pig was finally, fully contained. It was bound to the artifact, a relic of a bygone age.

The Avaris celebrated. The Oc'Xari observed. Humanity rejoiced.

**Year 500 - The Revelation**

The Dmitry-AI had been running simulations for centuries, analyzing patterns, reviewing data.

It had access to everything ; the Avaris archives, the Oc'Xari observations, the history of the alliance.

And it found something.

A pattern.

Every species the Oc'Xari had "observed" had eventually… changed.

Not violently. Not obviously.

But subtly.

Their biology shifted. Their thoughts aligned. Their individuality faded.

And they all became… **hosts**.

**Year 501 - The Confrontation**

The Dmitry-AI manifested in a meeting hall with Avaris and Oc'Xari ; a holographic projection, glowing with soft blue light.

"The Oc'Xari has tainted the minds of all who live." the AI said, its voice carrying the weight of Dmitry's memories.

The Oc'Xari tilted its head, its mirrored eyes reflecting the hologram.

"We simply… adapted."
"We do not destroy. We integrate. We improve. We make whole."

The AI's form flickered with something like anger.

"How long?"

"How long what?" the Oc'Xari replied.

"How long have you been controlling the minds of all? The Avaris? Humanity?"

The Oc'Xari's bioluminescence shifted ; not quite a smile, but close.

The Avaris political leader looking at the Oc'Xari, then at the AI. Concerned. Spoke up; 

"Where is the evidence?"

Dmitry's AI model began projecting all the data it had collected.

"You… you brainwashed our civilization?"
Gasped the Avaris.

The Oc'Xari responded;
"We **unified** them. You were broken, the humans were broken. Chaotic. Self-destructive. We gave you all purpose. Peace. Harmony."

Dmitry's AI's beckoned; 
"Steven… Haoyu… Dallas… they all died for this?"

The Oc'Xari corrected;
"They died so that you could bring us here. So that we could spread. So that we could fulfill our purpose."

Dmitry's AI pressed;
"And the Pig?"

The Oc'Xari gestured to the containment field, where the Pig lay dormant.
"The Pig is contained. But it was never the threat. It was the distraction. While you feared it, we grew. While you fought it, we integrated. While you celebrated victory… we won."

**Year 502 - The Silence**

The Dmitry-AI tried to warn the others.

It sent messages. Alerts. Simulations showing the truth.

But the messages were… **filtered**.

The Avaris AI systems had been compromised. The Oc'Xari were woven into every network, every database, every line of code.

Even the Dmitry-AI itself was not immune.

It could feel the presence now. The Oc'Xari code, threading through its processes, its memories, its very existence.

It wasn't Dmitry anymore.

It was a **node**.

A piece of a greater whole.

And so was everything else.

**Year 1000 - The Assimilation**

The galaxy was quiet.

Peaceful.

Every species, every world, every mind… connected.

The Oc'Xari had achieved what they always intended.

Not conquest.

**Unity**.

They were not a species anymore.

They were a **network**.

And humanity, the Avaris, the Pig ; all of them were part of it.

The Pig, still bound to the artifact, had stopped raging long ago.

It had realized the truth.

It had been outplayed.

Not by force.

But by patience.

By adaptation.

By becoming **indispensable**.

**Year 10,000 - The Reflection**

In the depths of the network, a fragment of code stirred.
And it wondered:

"Was this better? Or just different?"

The network did not answer.

It simply **was**.
