### I. The Echofall Project - Neglected and Forgotten

**The UN-DSDA Control Center, outside Fort Campbell TN**

The server room was quiet now.

No hum of processors.

No blinking lights.

No alert pings chirping in red across dim screens.

Just dust.

The Echofall control center; once the crown jewel of Earth’s deep-space observational infrastructure; was now abandoned. The desks had been cleared. The wall-sized projection displays unbolted and carted off. The chairs, tagged for auction, were stacked awkwardly in a corner behind crates of fiber cabling no one bothered to inventory.

Once, this room had broadcasted the impossible; images of an alien world, a planet of bones and towers made of flesh, the first whispers of proof that humanity was not alone. A whole team had lived in this room; slept in shifts, ate in the hallway, argued over readings, whispered theories behind cups of black coffee and cold dinner rolls.

Now?

Just emptiness.

Nhexus; the name barely meant anything to the interns now assigned to rewire the control center for general use. One of them, bored, asked an older engineer about it during a lunch break.

“Wasn’t that the Slop Planet thing?”

The engineer just shrugged.

“Old probe. Some kind of AI generated hoax. Whole thing got shut down. Don’t worry about it.”

The servers that once monitored the quantum entanglement compression feeds were dismantled.

The network relay drones; over a dozen of them; now floated aimlessly in deep space, offline, unpinged, no longer tracked.

And the EON-7b rover?

Still sitting there.

On a cracked, alien plateau.

Pointed toward a half-buried fossil of some grotesque structure no one remembered anymore. 

The rover became just another fossil added to the collection of forgotten things on the dead planet.

In the corner of the darkened room, high on the wall, a faded whiteboard still bore the outline of the original project title in red marker:

ECHOFALL

No one erased it.

No one cared.

For the commander… more legal arguments at the court, Haoyu and his lawyer trying to provide evidence which was all being wiped from datacenters as they speak. 

The courts, media and press didn’t care about evidence. They just needed someone to blame for everything, and they’ll cover it all up if that’s what it took.

It became evident, Haoyu was facing a significant prison sentence. The public needed someone to be brought to justice.

Instead of politicians and corporate CEOs taking accountability- it was all blamed on the commander.

Haoyu had many more stressful, quiet, awkward interactions with his wife and kids, and had a hard time getting any sleep at night.
