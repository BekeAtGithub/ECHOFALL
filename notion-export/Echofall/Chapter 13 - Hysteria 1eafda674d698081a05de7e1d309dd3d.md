# Chapter 13 - Hysteria

### I. Earthbound Shadows

Eight months had passed since the first glimpse of Oc’Xari during the Easter of **2531**. 

Since then, the signal had been picked up by seven of Earth’s relay drones.

Each farther away. Each carrying more clarity.

It seems, the Oc’Xari wasn’t phased by the drones re-routing their paths in a scattered motion, they had already calculated and figured out where Earth was… they were coming.

And now the second drone; hovering a modest distance behind the first; delivered the most shocking data yet.

A massive quantity of Oc’Xari entities.

Thermal shadows flickering just beyond optical range.

EM pulses pinging from multiple directions.

Biomass readings unlike anything seen before.

“They’ve calculated the path,” said the lead analyst.

“They knew exactly where our planet was once they saw our second network drone, they just looked back towards where we came and seen all out network relay drones.”

In the command center, tension reached critical mass.

The mission commander stood silent, arms crossed, staring at the wavefront of approaching signatures.

It was a hyper-scale invasion, unlike anything humanity has ever seen.

They were coming.

The commander spoke apathetically; 

“I’m proud of you all, and I’m sorry.”
“Notify global military agencies… the cat’s out of the bag.” he said quietly.

And with that…

the dam broke.

The first leaks came from internal channels.

Encrypted comms. Shared screenshots. Redacted coordinates.

It didn’t take long before the public caught wind.

And when they did

Chaos erupted.

Some believed it was a hoax.

Others saw it as divine prophecy.

Many fell into denial, clinging to the hope it was misunderstood.

But the patterns continued.

The drones continued pinging more signals.

It was undeniable now:

Something was coming.

Something alien.

Earth marked an X on their map.

Governments scrambled.

Religions split.

Militias formed.

"Prepare for first contact."

"Prepare for war."

"Prepare for the end."

Earth prepared for annihilation.

### II. Countdown to Arrival

As the Oc’Xari watchers continued their charge, analysts across Earth scrambled to measure their velocity.

And the numbers were worse than expected.

“They’re faster than the meteor.”

“Far faster.”

“Three years. Maybe less.”

What had once been a slow, creeping mystery became a sprint toward inevitability.

Earth had three years.

Three years to prepare.

Three years to defend.

Three years to survive.

Every major nation raised its taxes.

Drastically.

Funding diverted from civil infrastructure.

Budgets gutted from arts, education, and health.

Every spare ounce of GDP was channeled into military production, orbital defense networks, AI weapons design, and deep space tracking arrays.

Entire industries pivoted overnight.

Civilian companies became war contractors.

University labs were nationalized.

Governments established 24/7 readiness bunkers and blacksite command centers.

The world turtled in.

“They are coming. We have no choice but to give it everything we got.”

But not everyone agreed.

Mass protests ignited across the globe.

Millions believed the watchers were not enemies; but **visitors**.

They formed global peace coalitions.

They held signs with messages like:

- “WE ARE NOT AFRAID”
- “WELCOME THE STARS”
- “THEY COME TO SEE, NOT TO KILL”

Anti-protester groups formed in equal numbers.

Riots broke out.

Entire cities devolved into street wars between fear and hope.

Nations split ideologically.

Governments collapsed under pressure.

Militaries declared martial law in dozens of regions.

Crime exploded.

Faiths fractured.

Suicides spiked.

For every scientist studying the approaching anomaly, a thousand civilians whispered:

“They’ll wipe us out.”

“This is the Judgment.”

“We’re the next Nhexus.”

### III. Human Stories Beneath the Storm

The world spun forward in fear, but within its noise were millions of small, intimate lives, trying to make sense of an unraveling world.

### 1. **Nadine Keshet – Teacher, Samarkand**

Every morning, Nadine stood before her fourth-grade students trying to keep them focused.

She taught Earth science, but the curriculum hadn’t caught up.

But her students asked questions now:

“Will the aliens come to our house?”

“Do they know what cats are?”
”What kind of food do they eat?”

“Will they hurt us?”

And Nadine; calmly, gently; told them happy, joyful sci-fi stories.

She told them about space travel.

About stars.

About curiosity.

About beautiful and fun made up interstellar toys the kids would cheer in excitement for.

She never said the word *war*.

But she had a packed bag at home with a full fledged survival plan, just in case.

### 2. Dalton **“Stalwart” Bardwell – Former Maximum Security Prisoner, Detroit**

**Stalwart**, a 300 lbs genetically enhanced muscle man covered in tattoos had been out of prison for just seven months when the Oc’Xari signal hit the streets.

He worked nights at a scrapyard, traded cigarettes for breakfast, and tried to keep his name out of databases.

But the world didn’t care who he used to be.

It was falling apart too fast.

When the riots came, he was the first to stop a looter from smashing the corner store.

Not because he believed in peace.

But because the store owner was 81.

And that old man gave him bread once in a snowstorm.

Now Stalwart walked the neighborhood at night protecting family owned shops and innocent civilians from crime like a superhero. Fully plated in hyper-steel armor with AI-Implanted gadgets, armed with a military grade M4b8 modern high tech rifle.

Some called him a vigilante.

Some called him delusional.

But he called it paying rent.

“Looters, Gangsters, Aliens - Don’t matter, they gotta get through me.”

### 3. **Iseul Jungwon – Tattoo Artist, Daegu**

Business exploded when the signal reached South Korea.

People came from cities away to get inked with alien symbols, star charts, or imagined faces of the watchers.

One man came in and asked for a tattoo of the Nhexus pyramid fossil structure.

She asked him if he wanted something *that* ugly on his body.

He nodded.

“It’s real. It means we existed. It means we saw them.”

Iseul gave him the best work she’d ever done.

Not because she believed in it.

But because she wanted the watchers; if they ever looked at us, to see we marked our skin with what we feared most.

### **4. Master Lin Yusheng – Monk, Taishan Mountain, China**

The wind on Mount Taishan had changed.

It carried whispers now; fragments of radio chatter, tremors of satellites, the breathless panic of a world that had just discovered it was seen.

First, Nhexus. And now, an imminent invasion.

Master Lin had lived through war before. Not on the battlefield, but in the aftermath; mending limbs, boiling roots, praying for peace long after others had lost the will to ask for it.

But this was different.

The Earth shook in fear.

And Lin, high in his mountain temple, could feel it tremble beneath his sandals.

The university students from the village below brought him the news; first about the slop-creatures of Nhexus, then the sky-borne watchers of Oc’Xari.

They asked for his wisdom.

“Master Lin… if the heavens are just, how can they allow such beings to exist?”

He said nothing as he stared into the trees and listened for the wind's answer.

One student returned from the city, crying.

“They’re building weapons with AI that learns to kill faster. They’re calling them ‘preemptive gifts for the stars.’”

“Master Lin… are we going to kill them first?”

Lin simply asked:

“And if we do… what have we become?”

The global feeds filled with false prophets, collapsing governments, and new sects preaching surrender or sacrifice.

Lin watched none of them.

But every dawn, he made his tea, fed the crows, and swept the courtyard.

He could not stop the invasion.

He did not understand the slop planet.

But he did believe this:

“The sky has always watched us. Maybe now it is simply blinking.”

And whispered:

“Even if we die… let us die with honor.”

### 5. **Abhishek Bakshi – Underworld King Pin, Hyderabad**

In the chaos, opportunity blooms.

Abhishek Bakshi knew it better than anyone.
He ran data laundering, crypto markets, scam call centers, brokers for black-market neural mods and synthetic drug labs from the basements of a high-rise that pretended to be condemned.

Now, as the world fractured, his services were in higher demand than ever.

- Corporate executives paid to flee cities.
- Mercenary groups bought early access to private defense tech.
- Even minor governments funneled funds through his channels to bypass embargoes.
- Assortments of people ranging from low lifes to corporate executives buying drugs and body mod enhancements because “YOLO”

Bakshi didn’t care if the aliens came in peace or war.
He cared about margins.
And the margins were excellent.

He stared at the stars one night on a rooftop, a perfecto Nicaraguan cigar in one hand, sipping from a tumbler of fine single malt peated Islay scotch with notes of smoke, salt, toffee, oak and butter.

“They’ll come and go,” he said to no one, drawing in smoke from the cigar
“But I’ll own half this damn planet by the time they leave.”

### 6. **James Kokayko – Truck Driver, Whitehorse, Yukon**

James Kokayko had been driving the Alaska Highway for twenty-three years.

He knew every pothole, every frost heave, he knew all the local moose, buffalo, and grizzly bears by name at this point.

"There's old Nancy crossing the road with Jim again..." He'd say to the pair of wolves that crossed the highway near Carmacks, Yukon.

His rig was a 2518 Kenworth T880 with a custom sleeper cab, heated floors, and Starlink satellite.

He hauled everything: mining equipment, fuel drums, frozen goods, construction materials for remote communities.

The highway was his office. The radio was his companion.

When the news broke about the Oc'Xari, James was somewhere between Teslin and Watson Lake, hauling a load of prefab housing panels to a settlement near the border.

He heard it on the CB first.

"You hear about the aliens, Kokayko?"

"Yeah, I heard. Probably just government propaganda. They do shit like this before every election. The news gets crazier each year."

But the chatter didn't stop.

Every trucker on the highway was talking about it.

Some were scared. Some were excited. Some were making jokes.

James just kept driving.

He had a schedule to keep. A family to feed. A mortgage on a little cabin in Whitehorse.

Aliens or no aliens, the world still needed supplies.

But as the weeks went on, things got stranger.

The highway traffic thinned out. Fewer trucks. Fewer cars.

Some communities stopped ordering shipments altogether.

Others stockpiled like it was the end of the world.

James kept driving.

One night, parked at a rest stop near Liard Hot Springs, he sat in his cab eating canned chili and watching the northern lights dance across the sky.

They were brighter than usual. More active.

He'd seen the aurora a thousand times, but this felt different.

The colors moved in patterns that didn't seem random.

Swirls. Pulses. Almost like… communication.

He shook his head, laughed at himself.

"You're losin' it, buddy."

But then his radio crackled.

Not the CB. The AM/FM.

Static. Then a voice.

Not English. Not any language he recognized.

Just… sound. Rhythmic. Melodic. Almost like singing.

He turned the dial. Every station was the same.

He shut it off.

Sat in silence.

When he got back to Whitehorse, the town was different.

People were hoarding. Fighting. Praying.

His wife met him at the door, tears in her eyes.

"James, they're saying the aliens are coming. They're saying it's real."

He held her.

"I know, people are going absolutely nuts."

"What do we do?"

He looked out the window at the mountains, the forests, the endless sky.

"If aliens wanted us dead, we would be dead already. So if they're real, we'll be fine."

He kept driving. Kept hauling. Kept the supply lines open when others gave up.

He became a lifeline for remote communities that had been cut off by panic and fear.

People started calling him "The Last Trucker."

And if the world was ending, James Kokayko figured he might as well go down doing what he loved.

Driving. Alone. Under the northern lights.

### 7. **Dallas Red – The Wranglin’ Cowboy, Saskatchewan Prairies**

From a townless countryside farm in Saskatchewan Canada

Dallas Red didn’t own a smartphone.
He didn’t own a TV.
He lived like it was 1955; because, in his mind, the modern world hadn’t produced much worth keeping.

He heard about the aliens the same way he heard about last year’s drought:
Over coffee at the co-op, between stories about flat tires and fence repairs.

He didn’t believe it.
Not really.

“Aliens? Sure. And next you’ll tell me they pay taxes.”

But when the people in his town started panicking; packing up, breaking down, turning on each other; Dallas saw what mattered.

He didn’t buy the hysteria.
But if folks needed something steady to lean on, he’d be that.

Aliens were coming.
The world was breaking.
Cities were full of fire, riots, chaos.

So Dallas did what he always did:
He opened the barn doors.

Over the following months, his ranch became a makeshift sanctuary.
He didn’t hang signs.
Didn’t post to the net.

People just came from word of mouth.

He converted the hayloft into sleeping quarters with wool blankets and cedar planks.
Cleared out two old storage sheds, outfitting them with salvaged cots and propane heaters.
Built a communal firepit in the pasture where the fence had long since collapsed.

Families from Calgary, Regina, Saskatoon, even Winnipeg found their way there.
Seventeen households in total plus a few other individual scragglers.

He converted the hayloft into sleeping quarters.
Cleared out old storage sheds to house the displaced families.
Used spare tractor parts and rusty extension cords to wire a backup generator from an ancient windmill.
Hauled buckets of well water every morning.
But the most important thing he did?
He stayed calm.
He just rolled his sleeves up, passed around mason jars of moonshine, and played lazy old guitar riffs by the fire. 

In his kitchen, he’d have blues playing on the music box with the window open so you could hear it from the deck outside while they barbecued. He taught all his guests how to farm, proper ways of tending to animals, and other farm chores. Pretty soon, he had trained a whole self-sustaining community.

He sat with the kids and told tall tales about sasquatch and ghost coyotes.
He played poker with the dads.
He taught the moms how to fix a carburetor with a spoon.

And his slow-draw, good-natured attitude became the emotional spine of the place.

He just nodded once and said:

“Ain’t no point in dying scared if you can live brave.”

By month three, most of them didn’t talk about aliens anymore.

They just called it "Red’s Ranch."

And a few even started saying what Dallas said from the beginning:

“It’s probably just a government hoax anyway, this will all blow over and we’ll return to normal life again.”
