# Chapter 31 - The Bayou Prison

**Angola Supermax Facility in Louisiana**

And finally; 

Haoyu Zhang.

Once a commander.

Once a father, a scientist, a hero.

Now?

Just a ghost.

A skeleton folded into a metal shoebox no wider than a coffin.

Ten years in a windowless cell, a solid windowless door with just a slot, with the fluorescent light on above him the entire time.

He would fight sleep, but he would pass out from sleep deprivation every 4-7 days depending how long he resisted - when he did sleep, the Pig came and tormented him relentlessly.

When he was awake for more than a couple days - sleep hallucinations would kick in - he would think the pig was out in the hallway of his cell, talking to him, banging on the cell door.

Haoyu’s cell didn’t have a toilet, rather; he pissed into a hole in the center of his room.

Shit into the same one - and as he was doing his business, the Pig would often startle him - making him think the pig would reach its hand out of the hole, tickling his ankles and butt cheeks and reaching up his ass, completely humiliating him.

Haoyu didn’t eat, so the guards gave him nutrient injections twice a week, mostly just to keep his brain alive for the pending execution.

The guards had to restrict him each time, because Haoyu would go insane, thinking the guards were pigs tormenting him.

He thought he could hear it breathing behind the walls.

Sometimes, he screamed for hours - he would scream at the pig to get out of his head… in such moments, the other prisoners and prison guards collectively believed he was mentally insane.

Sometimes, he tried to chew his own wrists, the guards would have to come and cuff his hands behind his back to make him stop.

The Pig was always watching.

In seven days, he would be transferred to a supermax in Mississippi, where they’d begin the execution protocols.

Prep his body.

Broadcast the sentence.

Erase the last traces of the Echofall project from Earth.

Just another victim, painted as a criminal with the colors of propaganda and conspiracy.

Just another lie buried under history.

Seven days.

Seven long, uneventful days had passed.

Nothing had changed for the world.

But everything was about to change for Haoyu Zhang.

The morning of the seventh day, the prison warden stood in the control tower of Louisiana Supermax, reviewing the plan with a heavy heart and a dry mouth. His reputation was clinical, emotionless ; but even he knew:

“The once exalted Commander Zhang is gone. What’s left down there ain’t a man anymore.”

One of the ex-military prison guards spoke up 

“Do you think Zhang would have turned out a little better if he got a normal sized jail cell?”

The room was quiet for a moment… although they never met or worked with Commander Zhang, he *was*-or used to be recognized and respected in the military and science community… none of these guards felt good about the situation… they knew that wasn’t the real Haoyu Zhang who once dominated space.

The warden breathed out heavily.

“Our job is to obey authority, the decision was not ours to make.”

“NOW” - he promptly followed up, back in action.

He tapped the whiteboard with a composer stick displaying a drawn schematic.

“We don’t open that cell unless we’re wearing armor and weaponized to the teeth.”

The plan was precise:

- One straight jacket ; custom-fitted, reinforced for psychotics, pressure-lock stitched.
- One human bite muzzle ; designed for high-risk mental wards.
- One guard manning the net gun, modified with durable sticky mesh.
- Two guards wielding 8-foot electric restraint rods, meant to pin and disable Haoyu from a distance.
- And finally, six more guards, stacked and ready to dogpile, hold, bind, and carry.

**Cell 09A.**

The light had been on for ten years straight, in Zhao’s shoe closet.

His body reeked of sweat, vomit, shit and piss.

His mind ; hollowed.

He sat there. Hunched. Jaw twitching. Lips muttering inaudible things to someone who wasn’t there.

“They’re coming, the pigs are coming… I can hear them. They’re gonna open the door. Don’t let them… don’t let-”

**CLANK.**

The first lock disengaged.

**CHUNK.**

Second bolt.

He started hissing.

Mouth wide. Neck stretched. A half-man, half-feral rat thing, coiled in a corner.

The door swung open.

He launched at them ; a gnarled flash of growling filth and hatred.

The net fired. ZAP. The rods struck.

He shrieked like a boiling demon cooking in a cauldron of holy water.

The dogpile hit him like a collapsing wall. Elbows, knees, boots, rubber grips and groaning metal.

They strapped the jacket on.

He fought.

They forced on the bite muzzle ; black leather, reinforced steel. Clicked it tight as he snapped like a starved dog.

Haoyu’s breathing was wild, nostrils flared, his pupils spiraling.

“LET ME GO. IT’S STILL IN HERE. THE PIG IS COMING FOR ALL OF US! THE PIG WILL DESTROY THE GALAXY! YOU WILL SEE! YOU WILL ALL SUFFER IN THE UNIVERSE FOREVER!”

But no one answered.

They hauled him upstairs.

And then… the outside.

For the first time in a decade, he saw sunlight.

It struck his skin like acid.

He screamed, turned his head, kicked wildly.

He melted under the brightness ; like a vampire fed to dawn.

Flashbacks detonated across his brain like landmines:

**FLASHBANGS.**

POLICE! OPEN UP!

Remembering something about police breaking into a house he had been in a long time ago as if it was some broken memory of a past life he lived…

Crying children in his memories which he didn’t recognize (his children)

Some strange woman screaming (his wife)

Some wild buckin’ Cowboy that confused him even more… why is the cowboy so familiar?

Then ; something broke.

A crack. An epiphany! A break through the Amnesia.

Not in his body. In his mind.

“Wait…”

He blinked.

“My son…” he whispered through the muzzle.

“My daughter… my wife… Dallas… Pragnya… Dmitry… Yuyan…”

“Steven…”

For the first time in years, Haoyu remembered he had a family.

He remembered his crew, his home, his mission.

The guitar.

The saloon.

The sky.

It hit him like a flood.

He hadn’t thought about them in years.

The Pig had erased them through merciless torment.

He forgot he was even a human, he forgot what planet he lived on, he forgot he was even alive, he never seen a single human in a decade asides from prison guards whom he thought were pigs anyways ; all he knew was unyielding torture.

He didn’t know he had ever been loved.

He started to remember the night at the ranch when his kids were happy, laughing, playing, and his wife was cuddling him, smiling and living in peaceful, loving joy.

Tears leaked beneath the bite mask.

He was shoved, bound and limp, into the back of an armored transfer truck.

But it had windows.

Windows.

He stared through them in disbelief.

“The sky… The… The grass…” he mumbled.

The blue was pale. The clouds were faded. But it was still the sky.

The grass was littered with trash and highway dust, but it was beautiful. 

The engines hummed.

The truck rolled forward. 

Destination:

**Mississippi Supermax.**

A final cell.

A final breath.

An execution at last ; for a man who’d already died a long time ago, just hadn’t been buried yet.

And far behind him, Cell 09A… the place he called home for 10 years.
