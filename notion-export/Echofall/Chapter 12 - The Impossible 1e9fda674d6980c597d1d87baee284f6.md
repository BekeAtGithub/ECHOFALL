# Chapter 12 - The Impossible

### I. The Relay Horizon

Project Echofall was born ; an AI-navigated, magnetically-latched probe-rover hybrid, programmed to intercept the meteor, lock onto its surface, and deploy long-range autonomous scouts as it passed other systems.

Every year after the initial launch - Earth launched an additional assistant drone towards the trajectory of the Echofall probe. These complementary drones acted as network relays, boosting signal integrity across astronomical distances.

Humans weren’t expecting to find alien life with this mission. The goal was simply to *see more*:

“We’ll throw a seed at the stars. Let’s see what we discover.”

It is now **2532**. ****Nearly 19 years had passed since **2514** when ****the first network relay drone left Earth and landed on Nhexus in **2530**.

Unlike the meteor-bound Echofall, these relays were slow; optimized for endurance, not velocity. They coasted patiently, methodically, collecting passive data while strengthening the comms web.

Now, at the edge of its journey, the first relay drone approached a planetary system previously dismissed in initial scans of the Echofall rover as the meteor whizzed by it too fast to properly study its surroundings. But this slower relay drone detected it…

A dim, slow-burning star.

A world wrapped in deep cloud.

A planet unknown to humanity, but very familiar to something else.

Oc’Xari.

The drone registered only minor telemetry pings; no visible structures, no radio waves, just dense atmosphere and unexplained magnetic eddies.

But it lingered there.

Its AI directed it to perform a full orbital loop for better scanning angles.

On Earth, analysts noted the behavior; but found no cause for alarm.

Just atmospheric interference. Low-grade curiosity.

They didn’t know anything about this planet, they didn’t know the drone was being watched.

They didn’t know it had caught the attention of something *familiar*.

Back on Nhexus, the EON7-b rover continued collecting data.

More tissue samples. More resin fossils. More broken structures carved from pain.

And occasional shadows.

Once every few weeks, a glitch. A motion blur. A silhouette reflected in bone.

Each time, it caused a small eruption in the control center.

"We need a better lens."

"Did it move differently this time?"

"Was that a limb or a tool?"

But nothing ever resolved clearly.

### II. Eyes on Oc’Xari

The network drone’s systems were not designed for discovery.

They were meant to relay; to bounce, boost, and bridge signals across black space.

They carried no weaponry, no translators, no planetary descent packages.

But as the relay reached Oc’Xari’s orbital line, its sensors began to shift.

Something about the planet triggered its passive observational routines:

- Gravity fluctuations inconsistent with planetary mass alone
- Magnetic field pulses that resembled decaying logic circuits
- Static patterns in the clouds; too structured to be weather

The drone's AI logged the anomalies. It adjusted its camera arrays. It slowed its velocity.

Oc’Xari was a world of deep contrast.

From orbit, it appeared calm. A vast swirl of storm-draped continents and veiled oceans. No cities. No lights. No satellites.

But as the drone focused deeper; infrared, ultraviolet, EM resonance; it began detecting subtle irregularities:

- Infrared shadows that didn’t match surface heat
- EM patterns echoing across the planet in near-regular intervals
- Strange gaps in cloud cover forming and re-forming like optical camouflage

Then the drone’s directional array was hit by a soft pulse.

A signal of presence.

Its translation heuristic flagged it as structurally similar to the EM pulses observed from the entity back on Nhexus.

It transmitted the data back to Earth.

The science team stared at the signal logs.

One word began to circulate the lab:

"Same."

Whatever was watching the rover on Nhexus had the same signal data as what was being picked up on this planet.

### III. Puzzle Pieces

As the structured signal from Oc’Xari settled into the control logs, the room fell into rapid analysis.

A new thread of reasoning had begun to take shape.

One of the astrophysicists, reviewing trajectory archives, pulled up the original path of Project Echofall.

“Wait a second… the meteor Echofall hitched a ride on; it passed this planet. Oc’Xari was in the path.”

She overlaid the timeline.

The orbital proximity.

The delay.

And the realization hit the room like a silent detonation.

"That ghost entity isnt a native of Nhexus."

"They came from *here*. They saw our drone fly by and they followed us… but how?"

Echofall, in its slingshot arc, had unwittingly brushed past an ancient, dormant watcher world.

The thing watching the rover; the presence on Nhexus; had followed the probe’s path.

And now the gap made sense.

That delay; between when EON-7b landed and when the anomalies first appeared; it wasn’t confusion.

It was **travel time**.

“They needed time to arrive.”

“They followed us. Like barnacles on a ship.”

And so the math began.

The timeline cross-referenced.

The first signal echo from Nhexus logged precisely 23.4 days after landing.

Back-calculated, it logically aligned with Oc’Xari’s planetary distance and the likely trajectory of an autonomous watcher organism.

### IV. The Relay Path

Humanity's reaction was swift; but not loud.

There were no press releases. No public briefings, the close knit team did a good job at keeping the discoveries a secret.

Just data teams, code audits, signal triangulations.

The relay drone orbiting Oc’Xari became a full-time subject of study alongside Nhexus.

Its cameras were crude; meant to track stellar drift and cosmic microwave interference, not photograph planetary surfaces.

Still, the team fed its feed through every possible lens filter.

They tried to extract shapes, outlines, topographies.

But Oc’Xari remained obscured.

A planet hidden beneath haze, magnetism, and strange geometry.

Then, three and a half months later, something unprecedented happened.

The **next relay drone in line;** launched from Earth a year after the first; was still hundreds of millions of kilometers from Oc’Xari’s system.

But it picked up **the same signal**.

Identical pattern.

Same structural EM language.

Same subtle waveform layering.

"That doesn’t make sense," muttered a lead technician.

"It shouldn’t have the resolution or sensitivity to pick that up yet."

Nervous chatter swept through the comms room.

If the signal range was that large…

If the entity’s reach was that broad…

Was it extending toward them?

Or had it always been that large?

Two months later, the third relay drone picked up the same signal.

Over a billion kilometers away.

This time, the frequency contained minor alterations; a pulse shift, a new harmonic bloom.

The Earth team plotted the relay locations on a 3D galactic map.

They added the meteor path.

And the shape became clear.

A trail.

The same path *they* had launched along…

Was now being traced backward.

Every relay drone Earth had launched over the last ~18 years now served as a breadcrumb trail.

“It’s using our network as a guide.”

“It knows where we came from.”

The commander panicked and thought of a quick tactic 

“Uh… interfere the network relays target path, make them drift in completely different directions to try breaking up our trail”

The systems engineers were swift, and re-directed the navigation of the network relay drones to fly in an alternate directions, hoping it would confuse the entities and get them lost on the way to earth. 

… it was a good idea in the heat of the moment
