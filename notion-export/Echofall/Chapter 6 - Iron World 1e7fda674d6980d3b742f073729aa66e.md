# Chapter 6 - Iron World

### Ferron

“Like a forge, born from coal, fire, smoke and steel.”

### I. Planet Overview

- **Name**: Ferron
- **LUCA Seed Code**: Origin 030N-Vk
- **Biome**: Windswept plateaus, ironwood forests, sulfur geysers, sprawling slag valleys
- **Dominant Species**: The Rhonza - evolved from mountainous ram-like mammals

**Physiology**:

- Tall, bipedal humanoids with ash-gray, brown, pale or oxidized blue skin
- Curved, high-arching horns with engravings and decorations used to denote class, piety, and profession
- Hooved feet for mountain travel
- Prehensile tails for balance
- Lungs evolved to filter forge soot and toxic volcanic gases

### II. The Iron Faith

The Iron Faith is not just a religion; it is culture. Every Rhonza believes in the sanctity of the Forge as both the literal and spiritual birthplace of life. They believe:

- All volcanos, fires, flames, forges and furnaces are connected in some spiritual way
- The divine presence, Anvilum, is a being of military order who forged the Rhonza from metal, fire and war

The Four Pillars of the Iron Faith:

- **Honor is Respect** – All tools, thoughts, and life must be tested by fire

- **Metal is Culture** – Ancestors speak through steel; art carved into all things forged

- **Labor is Worship** – The body must work, sweat and suffer for the forge

- **Fire is Life** – If fire dies ; so will life

### III. Society and Hierarchy

Ferron’s civilization resembles a sacred feudal machine. Every citizen is a gear, with the Forge being the engine of existence:

Major Castes:

- **The Sparksworn** – High priests and engineer-theologians who interpret holy schematics, sing blueprints into copper scrolls, and lead flame-sermons in Forgehalls
- **Crucible Houses** – Noble bloodlines descended from ancient ore-binders. Their blood is said to hum in rhythm with fire
- **The Steambound Orders** – Warrior-knights clad in brass-clad servo armor, wielding piston-blades and ash-hymn cannons
- **Glyphtenders** – Artisan scribes who etch mechanical scripture into gears, memory-leaves, and machine-bones
- **The Emberborn** – Commoners who maintain the Living Railways, lava-loomed canals, and roaming bell towers

Citizens are born into castes, but spiritual merit and technical skill can allow **“**heating upward.”

### IV. Technology and Sacred Engineering

Without electricity or digital computation, the Rhonza have created a world of steam-forged brilliance:

- **Holy Machinations**: Living machines run on thermal pulse codes etched into bronze cores
- **Cathedral Engines**: Towering machines of prayer that hum liturgical algorithms in steam harmonics
- **Writ-Cannons**: Fire glyph-inscribed molten shells that explode into sacred verses mid-air
- **Pilgrimage Balloons**: Zeppelins shaped like kneeling saints, powered by incense-combustion
- **Self-Binding Armor**: Servo exosuits that mold to their user, unlocked only by vocalizing ancestral hymns
- **Forge-Glyphs**: A written language made from pipe shapes, gear rotations, and metal-thread scripts

Blueprints are revered texts, passed down generations. Some forges have been kept burning for over 2,000 years, considered living holy sites.
