# Chapter 15 - Life After Chaos

### 1. Nadine Keshet – Teacher, Samarkand (Post-Arrival)

Three months after the sky dimmed, the Uzbekistan Ministry of Education invested in updated science textbooks.

They were heavier. Glossy. Expensive.

Inside: nothing about Nhexus. Nothing about Oc’Xari. Just diagrams of mitochondria and happy cartoon planets.

Nadine’s classroom had changed.

The kids didn’t ask about aliens anymore.

They asked about volcanoes, and why Saturn has rings.

But sometimes… they asked weirder things.

“Ms. Nadine, do animals have feelings like us?”

“What’s the difference between pretend and real if they both feel true?”

“Is memory a kind of dream we all agree on?”

She tried her best to answer.

But more and more, Nadine found herself telling stories instead.

Not facts. Not lessons.

Just stories.

Like the one about the invisible creatures who watched the world for years but never hurt anyone.

Or the one about the city in the sky, made of bones that grew in perfect circles, where everything was made wrong; but still wanted to be loved.

Her students always listened.

And once, a quiet girl in the front row whispered after class:

“If they’re still watching… I hope they think we’re nice.”

Every so often, a student would be seen off in a far side of the playground, seemingly talking and playing with an imaginary friend… such students would often experience changes in their personality, not bad changes… just different. 
Their encounters would be shrugged off as “they’re just kids, growing and finding themselves”

### 2. Dalton “Stalwart” Bardwell – Detroit (Post-Arrival)

Dalton went viral, the Mayor of Detroit handed him a Hero award. He was gifted a beautiful house on the lakeside, and granted him a universal basic income so he may live out a financially stable life.

He was recognized and celebrated, and a statue was built after him downtown. 

The riots stopped. The military pulled back. Grocery stores reopened.

Still… He did his nightly rounds.

Still wore his plated vest, kept the M4b8 loaded and close.

But he wasn’t fighting many crimes anymore, he was mostly doing community chores. Volunteering at the food bank, cleaning up garbage, helping school kids cross the street.

He helped folks fix stuff; gutters, generators, old drones turned into food delivery services.

The streets called him “Uncle Stalwart” now.

He pretended to hate it. But, he would blush inside.

Every now and then, someone; usually drunk; would mutter at the fire barrel of a shifty ghetto pub:

“Hey, remember that time the aliens didn’t kill us?”

And everyone would laugh like it was a joke they all agreed to forget.

Stalwart didn’t laugh.

Even without aliens, he fought an insane magnitude of urban civil wars and street crime. His 3 years as a vigilante was far from trauma-free. 

In the following months, Dalton received a particular distress call from Law Enforcement to check on a young girl claiming she was hiding under the dining room table from robbers in the house. When Dalton arrived on the property, he did a tactical sweep of the exterior of the house. There were no signs of entry, nobody was there… when the young girl let Dalton inside the home, the first thing he noticed was all the kitchen counters, cabinets and appliances were bolted upside down to the ceiling… It was this moment Dalton knew, regardless of what the masses believed, the aliens were in fact here.

### 3. Iseul Jungwon – Tattoo Artist, Daegu (Post-Arrival)

Business slowed after the Arrival.

No more people rushing in with wild ideas about alien script or Nhexus tower etchings.

Now it was back to tigers, koi fish, and roses.

Still, Iseul left the Slop mural on her shop’s back wall.

Twelve feet tall. Inked in brushstrokes of mud and blood-tone reds.

A tower of malformed faces rising into smoke.

Some customers looked at it and said:

“That’s ugly. Why don’t you paint over it?”

Iseul never answered.

She just maintained her equipment and let them talk.

One quiet night, Iseul was conducting general housekeeping of her shop, when she heard the door open with the chimes ringing, she said a half ‘Welcome-’ pausing mid word when she saw there was nobody there, and the door was still closed.

She packed up, closed the store for the day and went home.

### 4. Master Lin Yusheng – Monk, Taishan Mountain, China (Post-Arrival)

The wind on Mount Taishan had changed.

It no longer carried the rustle of old forest or the chatter of sparrows alone. Now it brought fragments; whispers from the valley below. Satellite signals. Panic turned into static. A world trying to forget what it had seen.

Master Lin’s students brought him updates: headlines printed in haste, half-burnt clippings of leaders resigning, scientists dismissed, AI logs declared corrupt. They laid them at the steps of the meditation hall like offerings.

“Master,” one asked, “if they truly came, why did nothing happen?”

“Were they not gods? Or monsters? Why leave us untouched?”

Lin swept the stone floor without looking up.

“Perhaps not everything that touches us leaves a mark we can see,” he replied.

Some monks left the temple after that. Not out of fear; but restlessness. The silence of inaction had become unbearable to them. They sought answers in cities, in new temples, in strange beliefs springing up like weeds in a shaken world.

Lin remained, tending the tea garden. Repairing broken roof tiles. Lit incense for no one in particular.

The following week, plum blossoms had begun to bloom along the courtyard wall. Rain came lightly in the mornings; cleansing, not cold.

One such morning, Master Lin sat beneath the veranda, pouring tea from a clay pot worn smooth by time and steam.

He felt a door near him gently open, but nobody emerged.

That’s when he noticed the plum blossom petals.

They had fallen across the stone in an impossible pattern; *not random* as nature would allow, but arranged. Curved. Layered. Like art drawn in breath.

He did not disturb them.

He bowed his head slightly, and said aloud, though no one else was near:

“Ancestor, spirit, or star-walker;

If you carry memory across skies,

Then honor the virtue of restraint.

Harmony is not in power. It is in understanding.”
…
“The rites say a noble guest arrives without pride,

leaves with grace,

and listens longer than they speak.

If you are here,

then may you find what you seek.”

A breeze stirred.

The petals scattered in silence; every last one. 

The courtyard grew still.

And just as Lin turned his gaze toward the tea again; he saw it.

A shadow, humanoid figure, dark as soot, stepped into view. It crossed the stone courtyard soundlessly and opened one of the old wooden temple doors.

The door creaked slightly… then clicked shut behind it.

Lin did not follow.

He only poured the second cup.

And, eyes resting gently on the threshold, as he breathed out, he said once more:

“May you find what you seek, traveler.”

The wind carried the scent of plum blossoms through the temple for the rest of the day.

### 5. Abhishek Bakshi – Underworld Broker, Hyderabad (Post-Arrival)

The panic economy was gone.

Defense contracts dried up.

Crypto tanks.

Biohack mods outlawed again.

Abhishek adapted. He always did.

But business didn’t matter anymore.

He'd made enough to buy his way into any place, any identity.

And yet, he stayed.

Same building. Same office. Same broken chair with the red tape on the armrest.

He watched the news from seven countries at once.

Monitored the encrypted forums still whispering about *them*.

He noticed the trend no one else seemed to care about:

Memory inconsistencies. AI hallucinations mimicking watcher shapes.

Infrastructure behaving like it was… being observed.

Abhishek didn’t believe the watchers had left.

He would notice weird blips and bugs in his computers - ones that never happened before, and ones that were unexplainable, his security cameras would constantly alert him for motion triggers, and he’d check them to see nothing… he knew the aliens were here.

He believed they were *still collecting data*. Still watching through the systems they’d merged with.

And so he left messages for them.

In plain text, on notes on his front door, and buried in code.

Etched into packet delays.

A single phrase, over and over:

“I got connections, if you need any answers, or want to do business… I’m your guy.”

He figured if they ever needed a broker…

He’d be the first name on their list.

### 6. James Kokayko – Truck Driver, Whitehorse, Yukon (Post-Arrival)

The highway was normal again.

Traffic picked back up. Supply chains stabilized. The panic faded.

James was back to his regular routes: Whitehorse to Watson Lake, Watson Lake to Fort Nelson, Fort Nelson to Dawson Creek, back up to Dawson City. Same ol' roads.

The northern lights still danced. The mountains still loomed. The forests still stretched endlessly.

One night, parked at the same rest stop near Liard Hot Springs, James stepped out of his cab to stretch his legs.

The air was cold. Crisp. The stars were impossibly bright.

He walked to the edge of the parking lot, looking out at the dark forest.

And then he saw it.

A shape. Humanoid. Standing just beyond the tree line.

Not moving. Not threatening.

Just… there.

James froze.

His hand went to the tire iron in his belt.

But he didn't pull it.

He just stood there, staring.

The shape didn't move.

And then, slowly, it raised one arm.

Not in aggression. Not in warning.

Just… acknowledgment.

Like a wave.

James, after a long pause, raised his hand back.

They stood there for a moment, two figures in the dark, separated by a hundred feet and a billion years of evolution, waving at each other.

And then the shape turned and walked back into the forest.

James watched it go.

He didn't tell anyone.

Didn't report it.

But he pulled out a pen and notepad and wrote down a name - "Cordelle" - "That's your new name buddy, maybe I'll see you around more often."

James got back in his cab, and he had a schedule to keep.

### 7. Dallas Red – Saskatchewan Prairies (Post-Arrival)

The last pickup truck kicked up a cloud of dust as it rolled down the dirt road, a trail of kids waving out the back, cheeks sticky with honeyed bannock and sunburned laughter, one last joking consensus amongst the folks heading home about the whole alien thing was a big government hoax.

The barn had been a church for strangers, a shelter, a place to pretend the world wasn’t falling apart. Now it was just a barn again, smelling like cedar, hay, and spent lantern oil.

Dallas Red stood alone.

Chewing a long, dry piece of hay. Humming some old Hank Williams riff to himself as he stacked the last few bales in a tidy little corner.

The wind creaked the boards.

The barn settled like it was exhaling.

He scratched the back of his neck, reached for the rake, and mumbled:

“Well… that’s that, then.”

He’d miss the noise, if he was honest. The kids. The makeshift moonshine choir. The woman who patched that old goat’s leg like it was her own. He started talking to himself;

“They'd promised they’d be back next year. ‘Alien Day at Red’s Ranch’ they called it. Big laughs. Barbecue and disbelief.”

“Gonna be a damn civic holiday soon,” he’d joked back to himself.

But the party was over now.

Dallas turned to close the barn door, he closed the latch on it just to keep the wind from blowing it open. He turned around, picked up a bucket, carried it over to the far corner of the barn, put it in it’s place along with some other tools; and that’s when the barn door swung open.

A gust of cold air rolled in.

He didn’t even flinch. Dallas got excited thinking one of his guests came back for something. So he turns around squinted into the light and said:

“Well now, did you forget something, or”

He froze.

The hay dropped from his mouth.

His hands went slack by his sides.

Standing in the doorway; perfectly still, framed in golden prairie dusk; was something the world had claimed didn’t exist.

It wasn’t mist or shadow or EM blur.

It was there.

Oc’Xari.

Fully revealed. Shaped into a humanoid-like form.

A figure of geometry, matte crystal and folded symmetry; its edges breathing like lungs made of lattice.

Where arms might be, there was motion; flowing extensions that shimmered like smoke trapped in bone. One of them reached forward, longer than any human limb, impossibly slow and certain.

In its grasp?

Dallas’s guitar.

His old acoustic. The same one he'd strummed every night by the fire, calloused fingers plucking chords he'd never learned to read, just knew.

Only now, it wasn’t the same.

The body of the guitar was engraved; etched in microscopic perfection. Galaxies. Coordinates. Pulsar trails. Gravitational whirlpools. Unknown constellations. A map of the stars; not as we see them, but as *they* know them.

A small, ethereal hovering device, the size of a shotgun shell; floating half an inch above the sound hole of the guitar.

It spun in slow, weightless rotation.

Light shimmered through it in colors Dallas didn’t have words for; tones of blue that looked like ice crying, violets that smelled like lightning.

Tiny glyphs rippled across the surface.

At the bottom right of the body of the guitar, in silver script, engraved so fine it glowed against the woodgrain:

“Alien Day at Red’s Ranch”

Dallas didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Didn’t breathe, maybe.

Then, finally, like gravity snapped back into place, he took a half-step forward.

His boots crunched the straw.

He looked up into the shifting symmetry of the entity, eyes wide, and said:

“Well I’ll be a six-legged donkey.”

The Oc’Xari didn’t answer.

It just stood there, silently holding out the guitar like it was something sacred.

What Dallas didn’t know; what no one on Earth could’ve guessed; was that the entire Oc’Xari consensus was all watching him in deep focus.

He never flinched, begged, feared or believed.

He simply lived, and calmly helped his fellow neighbors.

And in doing so, he became more alien to them than anything.

They were intrigued.

They wanted to understand.

And so now, in the quiet of a lonely barn in Saskatchewan, the first proper contact began.

Not with the government.

Not with a space battle.

But with a man looking at a guitar etched with an alien map of the entire galaxy, and an ancient alien life from far far away, leaning in with anticipation. 

### *The First Note*

The barn was still. The sunlight through the wooden slats was golden and soft. Dust hung, refusing to settle.

And still the Oc’Xari waited, arm outstretched, holding the star-etched guitar as if it’s the most important object in the universe.

Dallas’s throat clicked, dry like a man who just swallowed lightning.

He wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans. Looked at the entity, then looked at the guitar.

He tried to speak; nothing came out.

Then, like someone hit a dusty jukebox in his chest, a breath rattled out:

“…I guess you wanna hear how this thing sounds, huh?”

No answer, of course.

Just the infinite patience of something that had never known time as a burden.

Dallas turned around. Walked three steps across the hay-streaked floor. Pulled a metal bucket from under the wall shelf.

He flipped it upside down with a clang.

Sat down slow.

Cracked his knuckles.

Took the guitar; like it was a pawn shop $5 special, and not the most valuable artifact in the galaxy; accidentally banging it off on one of the wooden support beams of the barn as he swung it up into his lap-”Whoops”

Plucked one string.

The sound it made wasn’t music.

It was the sound of honey turning to crystal under moonlight. The sound of mountain snow on Everest. The sound of a warm kitchen on Christmas Eve.

He took about a minute tuning it by ear like he’d done a thousand times.

Looked over at the alien, nodded once.

And then, quietly:

“Wrote this one for my wife. She passed a while ago. Never did sing it for anyone but her…”

He strummed and sang a slow, lonesome country melody; sweet and cracked like dry maple bark in spring. The words were simple. About love at the edge of a prairie, about holding hands through hard winters, about promises made around firepits when the world felt like it might end.

His voice was rough.

Honest.

Human.

### The Best Song in the Universe

But the guitar… wasn’t normal.

The moment he played the first full chord

It began to broadcast.

It amplified through the rafters of that dusty barn, shot through the hayfields, bounced from grain silos, and into the very crust of the Earth.

And then through every radio tower on the planet.

Every car stereo.

The refugees from Dallas’ Ranch recognized his voice and turned the music up.

Abhishek’s crypto mining computers froze up to play his song

Dalton’s M4b8 high tech rifle started playing music

Every emergency comm array, home speaker, television, museum audio guide, smartwatch, cellphone, tablet, walkie-talkie, and forgotten Bluetooth speaker under a couch in Nebraska.

People on subway platforms in Bangkok heard it through PA systems.

Soldiers in bunkers on front lines of conflicts thought someone was playing a prank.

Pilots flying over Greenland went silent in their cockpits.

Astronauts aboard the International Orbital Dome wept to the beauty of the music.

And out in space, every single relay drone from the Echofall network. From the farthest to the first, lit up. All at once.

They echoed the song outward; playing it through micro-transceivers, grav-laced amplifiers, and deep-space quantum lattices.

And finally on Nhexus

The EON-7b rover stirred.

Its speakers crackled to life.

In the middle of a wasteland of the dead slop planet of bone, among the fossils of nightmares, and beneath a sky where nothing should sing- blared the speakers of the rover, singing a slow, human song drifting like a campfire memory.

And every UN-DSDA control room on Earth fell into silence.

Every technician froze.

Every scientist stared.

The commander, sitting in the middle of a courtroom, across from a federal judge and his lawyer, felt his phone buzz in his jacket pocket.

He looked down.

Lead Systems Engineer: [Call Incoming]

He picked it up with trembling hands.

“Do you hear the song?” the engineer whispered, voice cracked with disbelief.

The commander paused.

From the courtroom speakers; Dallas’s voice was singing.

The room was silent and confused.

Everyone listened.

The commander closed his eyes.

Leaned back.

Swallowed.

And said:

“…Yeah.”
