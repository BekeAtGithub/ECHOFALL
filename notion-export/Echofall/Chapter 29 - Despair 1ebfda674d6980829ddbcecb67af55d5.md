# Chapter 29 - Despair

### **Two Years Since the Police Raid at Red’s Ranch**

**Day 821 of prison**

There were no more dreams.

No more signs. No symbols in the macaroni. No letters in the shower steam. No smudged alphabets in reflections.

Just the weight of memory.

And the haunted feeling of something watching… but never revealing itself.

Steven Young was the first to leave the facility.

The release papers said 821 days served. Early due to “demonstrated behavioral reformation” and a recommendation from the medical examiner citing “sub-clinical dissociation, likely prison-induced.”

They didn’t know it was the Pig that took his voice.

He didn’t smile when he stepped out of the gates.

Didn’t joke about gator hunting.

Didn’t spit a line of redneck wisdom.

He was quiet.

And that silence carried him all the way back to Tampa, Florida ; what was left of it.

The sky was grayer with smog. The streets were hotter. The oceans sat higher against cracked sea walls. The beaches littered with dog shit, garbage and homeless encampments.

Steven found a job delivering drone-dropped parcels for a mid-tier logistics company.

Owned, as irony would have it, by James Bethoz ; a name he couldn’t escape even now.

Steven’s resume said he once drove a rover on an alien planet. But nobody remembered - or cared, so now he wore a shirt that said “SwiftXpress”. He wear a VR headset he’d use to control drones for 12 hours a day delivering boxes of nutrient paste, disposable clothes, and AR goggles to wage-slaved tenants in vertical housing blocks that stretched so high they cut the sun in half.

Dmitry Alexeyev was processed a few weeks later and dumped back in Seattle.

He used to monitor interstellar transmissions.

He used to track anomalous quantum frequencies from satellites above the Nhexus system.

Now?

He mopped floors in a bio-plastic factory that smelled like boiling piss and fungal disinfectant.

Night shifts. Always night shifts.

He said it was because he couldn’t sleep.

But the truth was, he was afraid to.

The silence of the factory at 4:03 AM - that was when the fear came back.

The two men ; once legends in the Echofall Initiative ; now separately rented a slum module provisioned by the Emerald District Hive Program, a bottom-tier government-subsidized project of residential concrete stacks surrounded by graffiti, piled up garbage, junk drones, drug addicts, gangsters, crack whores and faulty neon signs.

They ate instant ramen.

Only had access to hot water twice a week.

Kept the lights off to save power credits.

The world moved on without them.

Alien dreams? Oc’Xari?

Slop worlds and thread cities?

No one remembered.

Nobody believed it.

And nobody cared.

Dmitry and Steven lived their own lives, apart in solitude for the next 8 years.
