# Chapter 25 - Serica

### **I. Serica - The Living Threadscape**

**Day 1 of the Dream’s Return**

Dmitry awoke first.

But there was no cot beneath him. No damp concrete cell. 

There was only... warmth.

A deep, living warmth. Like sleeping on the chest of something enormous and kind.

He sat up slowly, stiff as rusted scaffolding. His hands reflexively reached for a sidearm he hadn’t worn in years. There was none. Just silk.

The ground beneath him wasn’t ground at all ; it was a woven bed of organic thread, softly undulating beneath him as if it breathed. It shimmered with colors too subtle for digital screens: muted violets, iridescent oranges, ghostlight blue. Every thread had its own story.

Above, the sky glowed in waves. Not with a sun, but with vast bioluminescent creatures ; skybeasts, their translucent fins catching the wind like sails, carrying enormous, spindly structures on their backs. Living buildings. Cities in motion.

Dmitry narrowed his eyes.

“Not simulation. Not hallucination.”

His voice was gruff, thick with the iron of his old world.

“Dream transmission... I’m remoted in.”

The air smelled like morning tea and wild flowers. Humid, yes ; but not oppressive. The kind of air that healed you just by breathing it.

Behind him came a voice ; low, confused, unmistakable.

“Uhhh... Lex?”

“The weather here is a lot better than back in Canada…”

Dmitry turned.

Steven Young, barefoot, shirtless, wrapped in what looked like a robe made of moss and spiderwebs, stumbled toward him like a hippie in California on mushrooms.

His hair was wild, his chest sunburned, and his expression dumbfounded.

“What the hell kinda Florida acid trip is this?”

“Did you put somethin’ in the mashed taters again?”

Dmitry didn’t answer.

He was crouching now, palms flat on the living thread-road beneath them ; feeling the pulse of it. It vibrated. Softly. Like a heartbeat made of harpstrings.

Steven knelt and poked the ground.

“It’s like carpet if carpet had a soul.”

“...Don’t tell me this is another alien planet.”

Dmitry stumbled on words in awe…

He rose to his full height ; slow, reverent ; like a soldier waking on sacred ground.

His eyes scanned the skyline: a sea of living architecture spilling down a slope of mist-draped jungle. But this wasn’t a jungle like Earth’s ; it was softer, gentler, a canopy of breathing color. Thick vines like braided silk swayed with magnificent textures.

In the valley below them, an enormous woven metropolis breathed.

Literally.

Every building moved.

Not in crumbles or creaks ; but like bellows, like slumbering giants stretching in slow rhythm. Homes, towers, plazas ; all of them *were* massive organisms made of fur, thread, and curled spools of living silk. Some strutted on insectile legs. Others slithered forward like millipedes made of yarn. A few were airborne ; floating by way of gliding wing-creatures latticed with semi-translucent domes that swayed like jellyfish.

Bridges weren’t built ; they were spun in real-time, some unraveling behind travelers, others spooling outward in anticipation of foot traffic.

And among them…

The Sylvers.

Hundreds ; no, THOUSANDS ; of tall, soft-bodied humanoids walked with poise and calm purpose. Their clothes shimmered like cloudlight. Their eyes were luminous and soft, trailing hues of rose-gold and indigo. Ears long and pointed, skin like pale woven bark or soft moss. Some of them trailed vibrating silk behind them, letting it float freely in the breeze with steeze.

Steven’s jaw fell slack.

“I’m not even high,” he whispered.

“And this is the prettiest damn place I’ve ever seen.”

Dmitry didn’t respond.

He stepped forward slowly, boots crunching on a path that wasn’t dirt ; it was some kind of embroidered organic tapestry. It shifted beneath his weight like it *knew* he was there.

Steven lowered his voice.

“Ain’t no way this is just a dream.”

Before Dmitry could form a response, he is distracted by a low ripple passed through the silk underfoot.

Dmitry stepped back.

The weave beneath him quivered, then began to grow ; fine strands of lustrous violet and ocean-blue silk rising like smoke, twisting, knitting, shaping.

From the ground, a figure emerged with threads coming together to knit a humanoid.

It unfurled like a tapestry come to life, rising to its full height with grace unlike anything mechanical. And when it stood before them, both Dmitry and Steven were struck speechless.

It looked… like them.

Or rather, like a living sculpture of them ; a gentle fusion of their silhouettes, the shape rough but unmistakable: Dmitry’s broad shoulders, Steven’s long jawline, a blend of human posture and Serican artistry. Its body flowed with intricate robes of royal silk, the folds shifting between deep indigo and moonlit purple, glimmering softly in the bioluminescent air.

Its face was masklike ; two almond-shaped threads forming hollow eyes. No mouth. No ears.

But it raised an arm toward them.

Then the arm unraveled, and from the wrist sprouted fingers ; not five… but seventeen.

They bloomed out in all directions like threaded antennae, twitching and shifting, folding and retracting like a confused origami spider. It paused. Then began retracting some. Adding others. Trying combinations. Nine fingers. Seven. Eleven.

Each permutation hovered in front of Dmitry, as if the being were saying:

Is this right? No? This? This?

Suddenly, the ground beneath Dmitry’s feet pulsed.

And then... it grew hair.

“What the f-!”

A gentle strand of thread, as thick as a vine and soft as down, slithered up around his boot, curling upward with curious tenderness, wrapping gently around his wrist.

Dmitry went rigid.

“Steven. I swear to god, if this is some dream-larva tryin’ to mate-”

“Relax, Lex!” Steven said, wide-eyed but fascinated. “It’s just givin’ you a little handshake. I think.”

The silk curled around Dmitry’s fingers... then paused, trembled once ; and released.

The woven figure, still in front of them, retracted its 17-fingered hand.

Then slowly, like a sculptor getting the proportions just right, it re-spun the fingers ; this time, into a perfect five-fingered human hand.

Identical to Dmitry’s.

It held it up.

Open. Still. A mirror of his own.

Dmitry’s breath caught in his throat.

Cautiously ; like approaching a bear instead of a being made of bedtime fabric ; he raised his hand, matching the gesture.

They stared at one another.

Human and Weaver.

Man and mimic.

Woven silence.

Then, from behind:

“I think he’s tryna learn how we talk,” Steven muttered, scratching his stomach. “Y’know. Like charades. But with… hand noodles.”

He tilted his head at Dmitry.

“So go on. Wiggle your fingers or somethin’. Show ‘im what it means when you flick someone off.”

Dmitry sighed.

“We are ambassadors to an alien civilization, Steven.”

“Yeah. And you’re the diplomat with the grumpy face.”

The silk figure didn’t move. Just waited ; hand raised ; patient as the stars.

Then, with a mischievous grin, Steven raised his hand and extended his middle finger proudly, like a kid showing off a secret weapon.

“Let’s see if he learns this one.”

Before Dmitry could stop him;

SLAP.

“Idiot,” Dmitry growled, swatting Steven’s hand down. “That’s not diplomacy.”

But it was too late.

The Weaver paused… processed…

And then raised its own shimmering silk hand ; one long, delicate thread forming into a singular extended middle finger, elegant and absolutely unmistakable.

Steven cackled and howled a malicious laughter, doubling over and wheezing into the warm breeze.

“He gets it! Oh my God. That’s it. I taught the alien thread-dude how to flip someone off. I’m basically a professor now!”

Dmitry pressed a hand to his face.

“We’re going to be woven into a prison mattress…”

Still trying to salvage dignity, Dmitry carefully held up the Peace salute ; two fingers parted in the middle.

The Weaver blinked ; if those hollow eyes *could* blink ; and, with graceful accuracy, reconfigured its hand into the same gesture. A perfect replication.

That was when they noticed the crowd.

Sylver.

Dozens of them now, slender and tall, like trees turned humanoid ; their gowns spun from rainfall, their hair flowing in soft braids of living moss and whisper-thread. They clustered around in silence, their glowing eyes watching the display with unreadable curiosity.

They whispered to one another in a soft harmonic language.

And then, one stepped forward.

An elder, perhaps. Or an archivist. Their robes were layered with knotted scrolls and woven glyphs that shimmered like dew.

In their long fingers, they carried a frame.

It looked like a window made of silk, stretched and embroidered into impossible clarity.

They turned it toward Dmitry and Steven.

And there, threaded in astonishing detail ; with texture and shading made from hair-thin strands ; was an image.

Of Haoyu.

Not a likeness.

Not an impression.

A portrait, lifelike as a high-resolution scan, right down to the scar on his brow and the tired storm in his eyes.

Steven’s laughter vanished.

Dmitry took a step forward, stunned.

“How…?” he whispered. “That’s him.”

The Sylver holding the frame nodded slowly ; then turned, and beckoned them, saying some weird alien words.

The message was clear:

Come with us.

The Sylver and their woven companions ; those graceful silk-beast humanoids ; began to move.

Not with urgency, but with purposeful grace, gliding across the living streets in rippling motion, like a sea of threads pulled by unseen hands. Their woven city bent and flexed around them ; roads unrolling, archways rising, canopies blooming open above their heads like breathing umbrellas of lace and light.

They moved quickly.

Dmitry and Steven… did not.

The two men stood dumbstruck, still processing the silk-framed portrait, still frozen in the amber of confusion.

Several Sylver turned to look back.

One tilted their head, giving a soft vibrational hum ; a signal, a call to patience.

And then; without warning; the ground beneath Steven and Dmitry bloomed.

A cluster of luxurious silk tendrils rose behind their knees, gently but firmly toppling them backward into what could only be described as an extravagant, mobile sofa. Pillowy, lush, iridescent, and absolutely alive.

“Whoa! Whoa whoa whoa-HEY!” Steven yelped, arms flailing before he landed squarely on the plush throne. “Well damn. This is... kinda nice.”

Dmitry tensed, half-rising; until the sofa beneath him murmured with warmth, adjusting to the shape of his spine.

“This city is sentient,” he muttered darkly. “Thread-based auto-transport. Biocognitive silk.”

“It’s a freakin’ sofa Uber,” Steven grinned, sinking deeper. “Alien Uber! I’m gettin’ used to this place already.”

### **II. The Dungeon**

The living chaise carried them effortlessly, gliding in sync with the crowd ahead. Every movement was smooth, flowing like a river of fabric beneath their bodies. The street bent to accommodate them. The air shimmered with gentle light from above, and melodic pulses echoed across the structures ; as if the whole city was singing quietly to itself.

And then… the melody shifted.

The road tilted, gently guiding their chariot toward something immense.

Before them loomed a megastructure ; This was a living masterpiece, a being of threads so vast and intricate it seemed to defy anatomy. A towering woven beast, shaped like an elephant, a jellyfish, and a floating temple all at once ; its limbs spiraled into spires, its tendrils curled into vaults and domes. Every fiber of its body was art ; mural upon mural, fractal upon fractal, like it had spent a thousand years learning to express every emotion it had ever felt through architectural design. Sorrow. Wonder. Longing. Joy.

It was alive. And it was beautiful.

The structure's enormous gates unfolded, not like doors ; but like a blossom, petals peeling open, revealing a shimmering interior beyond. The chariot did not pause. It floated forward without hesitation, carrying Steven and Dmitry inside the creature itself.

Downward.

A long, spiraling descent ; not steep, but steady ; taking them through corridors of glowing tapestries, woven memories, and humming resonant strands. For thirty full seconds they drifted down into the depths ; not far enough to feel buried, but far enough to forget the sky.

And then… it changed.

The silk gave way to stone.

Not carved, not shaped ; just natural earth. Rock. Dirt. Dust. The living architecture stopped precisely where the woven world ended. It wouldn’t go further.

The chariot settled, the silk forming steps to let them off.

Dmitry rose first.

“We’ve reached the true surface,” he muttered. “Everything above this… was tapestry.”

Steven followed, barefoot on the soil, scratching his ribs.

“So what, this is like… under the rug? Alien undercity sewers?”

Before them stood three Sylver ; one of them still clutching the silk portrait of Haoyu. The elf nodded once, and turned silently.

They were led on foot now ; across the raw bedrock of Serica itself. It wasn’t a cave. There were no walls. No ceilings. Just a strange, wide clearing ; a forgotten pocket beneath the living city, untouched by thread.

After a short walk… they reached it.

A cell.

But not bars.

No chains. No steel.

The prison before them was formed from the ribcage of a giant creature, long decayed. Bone-ivory, yellowed with time, arching into a cradle of solemn isolation. Ancient, fossilized vertebrae were woven into the perimeter ; as if something immense and wise had died here, and the world had repurposed its body into a cage.

Inside, slumped in the center of the bone-spun room…

Was Haoyu Zhang.

Unshaven. Eyes hollow. His body trembling in a way that suggested the tears had come long before they arrived ; and that agony wasn’t new to him. It had become his companion.

He did not look up.

He didn’t even react.

He just sat there.

Weeping.

A man whose soul had already split open.

And who had no words left to patch it shut.

They stood at the edge of the bone-prison.

Dmitry stepped closer, his boots crunching dust beneath him.

“Haoyu?” he said, voice low. “It’s me. Lex. We’re… here. Somehow.”

No response.

Steven knelt, waving a hand in front of the man’s face.

“C’mon now, Commander ; snap outta it. You're in the land of throw pillows and sky whales, partner.”

Haoyu didn’t blink.

Didn’t flinch.

Just… breathed.

A rhythm so mechanical, so hollow, it sounded like a simulation.

He was a soul with no fire left.

The echoes of the past year had consumed him completely.

Betrayal. Loss. Imprisonment. Shame.

And worst of all ; the belief that none of it had mattered.

That perhaps the Pig had been right.

That they should have never followed the map.

Dmitry turned, fury clenched in his jaw.

“Why is he locked up?” he demanded. “Why this? Why here?”

The Sylver holding the silk portrait stepped forward. His tone was soft, but his gestures were deliberate ; indicating the cage, then Haoyu, then to a sweeping motion that stretched far beyond the room.

“We don’t understand you,” Dmitry muttered. “But you… want us to follow you?”

The Sylver nodded.

They turned and began walking. The other two Sylver with them motioned for Steven and Dmitry to follow.

They retraced their steps, past the ribcage cell, back through the raw soil of Serica’s surface, up the woven staircase carved into the body of the megastructure.

As they reached the light again, the colors returned ; vibrant threads painting stories across every wall and ceiling, humming with ancient memory.

And waiting for them just outside the structure…

Was a thread vehicle unlike anything seen before.

It had no wheels, no visible propulsion ; just a long, woven shell, shaped like a beetle crossed with a gondola, fibers humming softly with internal vibration. The front opened like a flower.

They climbed inside.

It was cool. Cushioned. Almost womb-like.

And it moved ; gliding above the living streets, silently weaving the silk beneath them into new roadway as it passed. Every turn was elegant. Every structure they passed vibrated in recognition.

Then, in the distance, a new kind of structure emerged…

Something different.

Massive. Looming. Elegant. Ornate..

Outside, two guards stood.

Tall ; even for Sylver.

Their limbs were longer. Their features more angular. Their silk robes were darker, edged with blood-red strands and embossed with symbols that glowed faintly.

But what drew the eye was their weapons.

They weren’t swords. Or staffs. Or guns.

They looked like… scissors… sorta… huh.

And though the guards did not speak, they bowed.

They were expected, and treated as guests
