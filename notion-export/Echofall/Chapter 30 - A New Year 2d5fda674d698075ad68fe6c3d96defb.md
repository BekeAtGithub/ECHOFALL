**2548.**

**HAPPY NEW YEAR**! the cities screamed.

**Ten years.**

Ten long, rotting, buried years since the raid.

Confetti in Los Angeles. Fireworks over Tampa. Candle-lit tables in Albany.

The world celebrated, oblivious to the cosmic horror buried in silence.

**Yuyan Chan** sipped champagne at a cousin’s house in San Francisco.

He smiled politely at jokes and stories he didn’t care about.

A warm room filled with light and laughter.

But when the countdown reached zero, his eyes flicked to the corner of the ceiling.

He swore, just for a second, he saw a thread... as if it was trying to get his attention - but was nothing.

**Pragnya Reddy** clinked a plastic cup at her niece’s party in Dallas Texas.

Her parents proud of her career accomplishments.

She forced a smile, but the grief over losing the project and team never left her.

**Haoyu’s son**, the one who’d fall asleep with the stuffed dino 10 years ago - is twenty now, sat at his narrow desk in a shoebox apartment four stories underground in Los Angeles Sector 77.

The screens around him blinked, analyzing anomaly reports for a defense AI firm.

It paid well enough to get by… but, not enough to afford an above ground condo unit with windows.

But on the corner of the desk; between an anime figurine and a cracked mug; 

was a photo.

His father.

Taken twelve years ago, before the trial, before the fall.

The son would never admit he cried last week. But he did.

Haoyu’s daughter, sixteen, wore glittery heels and a skimpy dress. Living with her 21 year old rich, famous, athlete boyfriend in St. Louis, Missouri

The basketball star mistreated her and joked to his entourage that she was “like some post-apocalypse fairy tale girl.”

She didn’t laugh.

They didn’t know she still had night terrors, or cared much about her past trauma.

Every time she hears loud bangs or thuds - the feint echo of the police raid flash banging the house - and the memories of the past pour in - so she puts up trauma walls, intentionally avoiding loud activities.

Their mother, alone in Albany, New York, wore the same cardigan she’d worn for the past three winters.

She stirred gray porridge on an old stove, the only light coming from three tiny picture frames hanging crooked above her table.

One for Haoyu.

One for her son.

One for her daughter.

She hadn’t spoken to either of them in over a year.

She whispered “Happy New Year” to the photos, and sobbed in tears for the rest of the night.

Dmitry, still in Seattle, mopped up spilled bio-ink from the factory floor.

The supervisor didn’t even nod at him as he passed.

At midnight, the pipes above groaned.

Steam hissed.

Dmitry looked up from his mop, exhaled a long breath, and whispered something in Sylver tongue; a phrase he barely remembered.

Then went back to mopping.

Steven Young sat on the beach in Tampa, surrounded by laughter and music.

He held a bottle of cheap beer. Unopened.

Bonfires lit the sand. Fireworks boomed over the ocean.

He didn’t blink when one exploded too low and startled a kid nearby.

He just kept staring forward; dead-eyed, numb.

A girl flirted with him. He didn’t hear her.

He only heard the bangs of the fireworks, remembering:

“POLICE! OPEN UP!”

**Calgary Maximum Prison**

Dallas Red sat motionless behind the same rusted bars.

He kept a drawing taped to his wall; a crayon sketch from one of the refugee children he saved way back during the pre-invasion chaos.

The kids drawing showed his ranch, the cows, and a stick-cowboy resembling Dallas under a smiling sun.

It was faded. Torn.

He stared at it for hours each night.

Sometimes, he smiled. But only a little.

The refugee families he’d once housed came and went.

They protested.

They shouted.

They marched.

But the world never heard them.

Their signs were banned.

Their videos scrubbed.

Their voices... censored by media… nobody outside from a few towns in Canada knew Dallas ever existed.

His name would fade into time of the coming decades.
