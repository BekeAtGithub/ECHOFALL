# Chapter 9 - Echofall

### I. Arrival at a Curious Planet

**2530**

Roughly sixteen years after a global effort to the launch of *Project Echofall*, the autonomous scout rover vessel detached from the gravitational slingshot of a distant gas giant and veered toward an odd uncharted planetary system; a faint glimmer on no previous star map.

What it found was a quiet, rotating mass around an old, withered home sun:

- Gray-brown textured surface with craters left behind by perhaps ancient oceans, long ago evaporated
- Faint atmosphere, made of argon, xenon, and ash traces

The AI's preliminary scans showed no signs of organic life, no weather systems, no tectonic activity. But one thing stood out:

A thin, fluctuating resonance field spanning the planet’s equator, undetectable by traditional EM-spectrum scans, but visible in gravitational lensing distortion.

The field pulsed at prime-number intervals.

The AI tagged the planet: *Candidate - LVX-014*. Status: Anomalous.

### II. Earth Reacts

The data packets returned to Earth in almost real-time via long-range quantum compression utilizing the 16 network relay drones launched annually, one at a time since the initial Echofall drone release. The scientific community initially met it with cautious curiosity.

"Unusual but not extraordinary," said a SETI analyst.

"Could be natural resonance. Planetary ring instability."

Government agencies grew interested.

The Echofall council voted to descend.

### III. The Descent

The **Echofall-5** satellite released its scout rover.

**EON-7b**, a planetary micro-lander, detached from the satellite's magnetic coupler and initiated autonomous descent. It was a marvel of brutalist engineering; titanium-alloyed, shielded against ion storms, with adaptive gyroscopic legs, and a spine of sensor probes like a mechanical trilobite.

Its descent was quiet. Controlled.

### Orbital Pass: The First Glimpses

As **EON-7b** entered low orbit around the planet’s equator, its live imaging feed sharpened with each atmospheric thinning. Its high-resolution cameras and lidar scanners swept across the landscape below.

The first visual fragments triggered debate:

- Straight lines and sub-urb style grid patterns in terrain where none should be
- Angular patterns breaking through the chaos of spongey terrain
- Mile-long shadow bands cast by vertical structures buried in storm-thick fog

At first, the science team at the UN-DSDA headquarters dismissed the formations as geological flukes; salt ridges, erosion patterns, tectonic fault geometry.

But then came the motion-corrected satellite stack, a composite layering of successive flyovers.

“That’s not erosion,” someone muttered.

What emerged from the processed terrain feed looked *planned*. Structured.

Whole swathes of the planet arranged in organic, radial formations; concentric growths that mirrored urban sprawl.

For hours, the feed was analyzed, debunked, reanalyzed, and debated.

No one used the word *civilization*.

### Descent to the Surface

EON-7b targeted the largest visible structure: a pyramidal mass; barely distinguishable from surrounding terrain at first due to its semi-organic contours.

As the drone descended toward the structure, its geometry was undeniable.

Triangular profile.

Symmetrical slope angles.

Massive. Three times the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Yet wrong.

It wasn’t stone.

It was something else.

### Landing at the Edge of the Monstrosity

EON-7b touched down on the rim of what appeared to be a dried swamp moat, crusted over with fossilized sludge and curled, blackened tendrils that snapped apart under the probe's weight.

The drone’s landing leg sank slightly into a gelatinous mineral patch; dried protein sediment mixed with petrified excretions.

High-resolution imaging swept across the front of the pyramid.

That’s when Earth saw it clearly for the first time.

### The Pyramid of Bone and Birth

The structure was not carved.

It was grown.

- Fused bodies, long dead, piled upon one another like bricks
- Arms, ribcages, tongues, antennae, bones and other weird body parts layered into its walls
- Entire spines served as load-bearing beams
- Cavities lined with molar-like growths
- Buried orifices fossilized mid-contraction
- Faces. Still twitching in posture, even in death

At the base of the structure was a petrified birth pit; a circular crater of hardened muck surrounded by dried up remains of half-developed creatures. Some bore the same limb four or five times. Others had no mouths, or multiple heads fused by sinew. A few were partially embedded in each other; as if trying to crawl out of one another mid-growth.

The entire structure radiated no electromagnetic signature, no power, no heat.

But the visuals alone were enough.

### Earth’s First Reaction

Inside UN-DSDA command center, for about 10 minutes, complete silence. The entire crew just stared at the live feed of the rover, completely flabbergasted.

Finally the commander spoke up,

“What the fuck am I looking at?”

A field engineer muttered:

“Looks like a pyramid… made out of alien creatures.” 

And the lead bio-anthropologist replied:

“Are those skyscrapers in the background behind the pyramid? Are they also made out of these creature formations?”

Another engineer made a remark:

“I don’t know what I expected aliens to look like, but it wasn’t this…”
