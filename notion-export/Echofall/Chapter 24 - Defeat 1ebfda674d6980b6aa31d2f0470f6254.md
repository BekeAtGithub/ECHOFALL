# Chapter 24 - Defeat

### Prison, Silence, and What’s Left

### Dmitry Alexeyev (AKA *Lex*)

The first few nights in the Low Security Detainment Block passed without sleep. Dmitry stared at the ceiling of his bare concrete cell, its single dim light flickering like a dying filament.

He didn’t speak for two days.

Not during processing. Not during medical. Not when the guards shoved him paperwork with the words *“Sign for your belongings.”* He just stared.

But on the third morning ; at lunch, Steven Young’s unmistakable voice shouted across the mess hall.

“Hey, Joseph Stalin! You still alive over there?”

Dmitry didn't laugh. Just his eyes twitched towards the source.

By shower time, Steven had shuffled into the stall next to him, soap in one hand, leaning over the divider with that crooked grin of his.

“Ain’t this just a fine goddamn mess?”

“We wanted to play aliens, and now we’re buck-naked in a concrete Motel 6 for terrorists.”

Dmitry finally muttered.

“The government betrayed us. They betrayed all of us...”

“Yeah,” Steven sighed, pressing his forehead to the cool tile. “They really did. After all we fucking accomplished.”

Neither man had family listed in the visitor logs. Neither had legal teams still fighting. They both knew what this was now:

Not justice.

Not rehabilitation.

Silence. Banishment. Decay.

### Dallas Red

**Cell 041-D** in the high-security wing of Calgary Central Correctional was windowless. A slab of cold concrete for a bed. Fluorescent light overhead that never shut off.

Dallas sat hunched, clutching his ribs where the door had hit him.

They had reset the bone, but nothing could reset the betrayal.

The old rancher replayed every second of the last month. The coffee in the Chuckwagon Café. The laughter of the kids. The guitar under the tarp. The dreams that changed him.

“I did everything right,” he whispered to no one.

“I gave them a place. I fed 'em. I believed.”

But belief didn’t count in a courtroom. And truth, real truth ; had no lobbyists, no press agents, no government backers.

Dallas Red, once guardian of a miracle, was now just a number.

And he began to wonder:

“Were the dreams even real? Or did I just lose my whole damn life for a crazy hallucination?”

### Haoyu Zhang

He had stopped eating.

That wasn’t protocol ; so the guards began injecting nutrient gel into his arm once a day through the slot in his containment pod.

Commander Zhang… was gone.

There was only a broken man now; a ghost wrapped in skin, confined inside a stainless steel coffin.

He didn’t move.

He didn’t sleep.

He didn’t speak.

They had stripped everything ; his name, his dignity, his legacy ; leaving behind a hollow man with nothing but recycled air and the faint hum of fluorescent lights to remind him he still existed.

It was called a “cell,” but it was smaller than a broom closet. This was not prison. it was a place that makes hell look more desirable.

The walls pressed in with claustrophobia. The lights overhead never shut off, so he couldn't tell what time it was ; or even if time still mattered. His wrists were blistered from restraint bands. His thoughts? Flayed open by a guilt that never stopped whispering.

This was the man who once led humanity’s most ambitious interstellar mission.

The one who sent a rover to another world.

And in return?

He got his wife institutionalized.

His children abducted and scattered.

His friends imprisoned.

His crew condemned.

His home destroyed.

His family ; broken.

His reputation ; incinerated.

His purpose ; shattered into dust finer than the Nhexus soil they first tested on.

Haoyu sat, spine curled, cheek against the cold metal of his cot barely big enough for a dog to sleep on, which was only there **for HR to check an “ethical” box on a spreadsheet which required all prisoners to have a “bed”.

“I was supposed to be there for them.”

He mouthed the words, lips barely parting.

“I was supposed to give them a future.”

A laugh caught in his throat ; not humor, but something ragged and feral.

“I followed the stars... and led us straight into hell.”

His voice broke on the last syllable.

And somewhere in the back of his skull, buried under exhaustion and ruin, a whisper remained.

The memorial voice of the Pig, still echoing on;

“You don’t belong here mortal…
You scoured Nhexus. You opened the gates. Now the gates open both ways.
You have seen far too much for the mortal eye.”

And it was right.

He wasn’t meant to see any of it.

And now ; he was paying the price.
