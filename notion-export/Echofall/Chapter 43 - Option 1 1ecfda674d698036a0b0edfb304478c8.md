# Chapter 43 - Option 1

### I. The First Choice - Do Nothing and Gamble for Everything.

“You know- I’ve been thinking.” Dmitry finally spoke after a long ride of thought.

“The Pig said, he can’t interact with physical objects that were made by things he didn’t create. The Pig can’t manipulate things physically, he doesn’t really have that much control. I don’t think he can turn back time either. If he had all this power, he could go get the guitar himself.”

Steven thought, and replied “Yeah, I thought about this several times throughout our trek… he also was getting impatient at the meeting table. Like if he wanted to get this all done asap, he would have found another way to do it… Dallas’s barn is like a fucking spawn point for demons.”

“-And the guitar is a link or a tuning mechanism for said spawn point”- added Dmitry.

As they pulled up to the police station, they looked inside and saw a dim light, just a lone police officer watching a tv show… looked like he was sleeping.

“What if the police station is also tainted by harboring the artifact?” Steven wondered out loud.

Dmitry pulled off to a side street, as they watched the police station from afar. Then he added- “I don’t really trust the pig, but I don’t trust the Oc’Xari either. And the Avaris seemed like it just randomly got thrown into all of this as a last ditch effort, they are probably just as clueless as us.”

“I’m gonna give you another option Dmitry.” Steven taunted goofily trying to imitate the voice of the pig. They both laughed a bit over it… then Steven continued “If the Pig is serious, I’m gonna die, but I somehow think he’s full of shit. And I'm a gambling man, I'm gonna spin the roulette of cosmos in the galactic alien casino. My option to you is - we go to the nearest gas station, fill up a few jerry cans - we come back to the police station, burn it down, and we go to the barn and we burn it down. Burn all the links that were opened to other worlds.”

“The police officer will extinguish the fire…” argued Dmitry.

Steven pulled his glock out checking the ammo - Dmity annoyingly rolled his eyes “ **tsssk** we are not going to kill the cop.”

“Dmitry I’m serious - this might even be a better idea - we kill the cop, we enter and burn the guitar and the new artifact they gave you with the whole fucking police station - then we go to Dallas’ Ranch and we burn that down too, and we escape to Northern Canada through the ice storms.”

Silence passed, just the sound of the soft, luxury engine humming of the SUV, and wind howling outside.

Without a word, Dmitry started driving down the street, until they reached a gas station. 

Dmitry went into the store to take a look around - he found a few oil filters, bought one.

They picked out a few jerry cans, filled them up with gasoline and placed them in the trunk of the SUV beside a nice big wrench… Dmitry grabbed the wrench and brought it with him to the front seat.
Then headed back to the police station.

**The Plan**

He pulled out a folded napkin and drew a crude layout of the station, based on their drive-by recon.

“There’s a back door here,” he pointed. “Likely leads to a small hallway. Locker room, bathroom, maybe holding cell. If the artifact’s locked up anywhere, it’s either in evidence… or the armory.”

“Or,” Steven added, “sittin’ on some dumbass desk ‘cause the guy inside thinks it’s just some busted alien banjo.”

Dmitry continued.

“I don't think we should kill the officer if we don't have to. I’ll go around back. Quietly. You go through the front. Start knocking, draw his attention ; talk to him, pretend you need help or something.”

“Then what?”

“Then I’ll sneak in, and I will beat him over the head with this wrench. We zip-tie him, gag him. Non-lethal if possible.”

Steven raised an eyebrow.

“Like how I non-lethally killed the drug dealer back in Seattle?”

Dmitry shrugged.

“Yeah like that - if it doesn’t work, we can shoot him - but that is only worst case scenario.”

“Got it, I’ll shoot down the snow bear if the plan goes south.”

Dmitry passed him the oil filter he bought from the gas station.

"When you shoot... put your glock barrel through it, it won't silence the shot, but, it'll at least make it a bit quieter. 

“Once he’s down, maybe thirty minutes before anyone even thinks to check in. We find the evidence locker. Grab the guitar artifact. Then we get out. Fast, and we can burn it in a field.”

Steven took a long breath. Then double checked under his jacket ensuring the Glock and magazines were secured, slipped the oil filter in his other pocket, and nodded.

“Alright. Let’s rob ourselves a police station.”

### II. The Assault

**The Break-In was underway**

They headed to their positions.

Steven walked up to the front door of the police station, his breath visible in the freezing air. He knocked ; loud, insistent, the kind of knock that said *I need help*.

Inside, the officer stirred. A middle-aged man, balding, with a gut that suggested too many donuts and not enough exercise. He looked annoyed as he shuffled to the door.

The officer cracked it open, suspicious.

"Yeah? What do you want?"

Steven put on his best distressed face.

"Oh thank God, officer! My truck broke down about two miles back, and my phone's dead. I've been walkin' in this cold for like an hour. Can I use your phone? Just need to call a tow truck."

The officer looked him up and down, clearly skeptical.

"Miles? Where's your truck?"

"Back on Highway 1, near the turnoff. Engine just died on me. I think it's the alternator."

The officer sighed, clearly not wanting to deal with this.

"Alright, come in. But make it quick."

He opened the door wider, and Steven stepped inside, stomping his boots to shake off the snow.

The station was small ; just a front desk, a couple of chairs, a TV playing some late-night rerun, and a hallway leading to the back.

The officer gestured to the phone on the desk.

"There. Make your call."

Steven picked up the phone, pretending to dial, while keeping the officer talking.

"Man, I appreciate this. You know, I'm from Florida originally. Never thought I'd end up freezin' my ass off in Saskatchewan."

The officer grunted, half-listening.

"Florida, huh? Long way from home."

"Yeah, man. You ever been? It's wild down there. I got stories for days. Like this one time, my cousin and I were fishin' in the Everglades, right? And this gator ; I'm talkin' a big one, like twelve feet ; just comes outta nowhere and tries to snatch the fish right off my line."

The officer raised an eyebrow, slightly more interested now.

"What'd you do?"

"What'd I do? I grabbed the nearest thing I could find ; a beer bottle ; and I chucked it at the gator's head. Bounced right off. Didn't even faze him. But it distracted him long enough for me to reel in the fish and get the hell outta there."

The officer chuckled.

"You're full of shit."

"I swear on my mama's grave, man. Florida's a different world. You got gators, you got meth heads, you got hurricanes. One time, my neighbor ; this old dude named Earl ; he got so high on bath salts he tried to fight a palm tree. Thought it was a demon or somethin'."

The officer laughed, shaking his head.

"Jesus Christ, alright are you gonna call this tow truck?"

Steven kept going, spinning more ridiculous stories, keeping the officer distracted.

Meanwhile, Dmitry crept around the back of the station. The back door was locked, but it was old ; a simple deadbolt. He pulled out a small pry bar from his jacket and worked it into the frame.

*Click.*

The door opened.

He slipped inside, moving silently down the hallway. He could hear Steven's voice from the front, still rambling about Florida.

Dmitry reached the corner, peeking around.

The officer had his back to him, leaning against the desk, laughing at one of Steven's stories.

Perfect.

Dmitry gripped the wrench, took a breath, and stepped forward.

But then ; the officer turned.

Their eyes met.

"What the—"

The officer's hand went for his gun.

Steven reacted instantly. He dropped the phone, pulled the Glock from his jacket, fumbled the oil filter over his barrel, and fired.

*BANG.*

The shot echoed through the small station like a thunderclap... but, muffled from outside at least.

The officer's head snapped back, a spray of blood hitting the wall behind him. His body crumpled to the floor, lifeless.

Silence.

Steven stood there, gun still raised, breathing hard.

Dmitry stared at the body, then at Steven.

"Fuck."

"He saw you. He was gonna shoot."

"I know. I know."

They stood there for a moment, the weight of what just happened settling over them.

Then Dmitry shook his head, snapping back to focus.

"We need to move. Now."

They ran down the hallway, searching for the evidence locker.

It didn't take long. A small room, locked with a keypad.

Dmitry cracked it in less than a minute.

Inside: rows of shelves, boxes, sealed bags. And there, in the corner ; the guitar case. Black. Old. Humming faintly.

Steven grabbed it.

"Got it. Let's go."

"Wait."

Dmitry pulled out the jerry cans from the SUV, which they'd brought in through the back door.

He started pouring gasoline ; on the floor, on the walls, on the desk, on the officer's body.

Steven brought the guitar case over and opened it.

The guitar gleamed in the headlights, its strings humming with that same eerie frequency. The sound hole was dark, impossibly deep.

Dmitry stared at it.

"This thing… it's a doorway. A link. The Pig said it himself."

"Then we close it."

Steven poured gasoline over the guitar, soaking it completely.

Dmitry pulled out the Avaris artifact from his jacket ; still pulsing faintly.

"And this?"

"Burn it too."

He placed it on top of the guitar.

"You sure about this?"

Dmitry nodded.

"Burn it all."

Steven pulled out a lighter, flicked it open, and tossed it onto the gasoline-soaked floor.

*WHOOSH.*

The flames erupted, consuming the guitar and the artifact in a roaring inferno.

The sound was… wrong.

Not the crackling of wood and metal burning, but something else. A high-pitched wail, like the universe itself was screaming.

The flames turned blue, then white, then something beyond color.


The boys ran out of the station as the fire spread, consuming everything.

They ran.

Out the back door, into the freezing night, the fire roaring behind them.

Driving off in the SUV, tires sreeching on the icy road, behind them, the police station slowly burned... by the time the neighborhood noticed, they were gone.

### III. The Barn

They drove through the night, heading back toward Dallas's ranch.

The barn loomed in the distance, dark and silent.

They parked the SUV a safe distance away and approached on foot, carrying the remaining jerry cans.

The barn looked the same as it had before ; old, weathered, but somehow… wrong. The air around it felt thick, oppressive.

Steven kicked the door open.

Inside, the barn was empty. No animals. No equipment. Just dust and shadows.

But the feeling was undeniable. This place was tainted.

Dmitry poured gasoline everywhere ; on the walls, on the floor, on the beams.

Steven did the same.

When they were done, they stood outside, looking at the barn one last time.

"Dallas would've wanted this."

"Yeah."

Steven lit a rag, tossed it through the door.

The barn exploded into flames.

They didn't watch, they ran to the SUV, and drove quickly away from the crime scene.

### IV. The Escape

They drove north. Fast.

The plan was simple: get as far from civilization as possible, disappear into the Canadian wilderness, and hope the authorities couldn't track them.

But they knew it wouldn't be that easy.

They'd killed a cop. Burned down a police station and a barn. Destroyed evidence. Not to mention all the stuff they "borrowed".

Every law enforcement agency in North America would be looking for them.

They were running low on fuel, but didn't want to stop at any gas stations in risk of being seen by cameras or witnesses.

They ditched the SUV in a ravine, covering it with snow and branches.

Then they walked.

For days.

Through blizzards. Through forests. Through frozen rivers.

They rationed what little food they had. Slept in caves. Avoided roads.

Dmitry's engineering knowledge kept them alive ; he built fires, fashioned tools, navigated by the stars.

Steven's survival instincts kept them moving ; he knew how to hunt, how to track, how to stay hidden.

But they were running out of time.

On the fifth day, they stumbled into a small town ; barely more than a gas station and a few houses.

They needed supplies. Food. Warmth.
The sign read "Welcome to Spiritwood, Saskatchewan."
Steven commented;
"The Spirits are with us."

They crept into the gas station, hoping to steal what they needed and disappear.

But as they were loading up, a man approached them.

Middle-aged. Dark skin. Well-dressed, despite the cold.

He looked at Dmitry, then at Steven.

And then he smiled.

"Dmitry Alexeyev."

Dmitry froze.

"How do you—"

"I know who you are. I know what you've done. And I know what you know."

Steven's hand went to his gun.

The man raised his hands.

"Relax. I'm not here to turn you in. I'm here to offer you a way out."

"Who are you?"

"My name is Bihiniwa Okonkwo. I represent the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And we've been watching you."

Dmitry and Steven exchanged a glance.

"Watching us?"

"The incident in Seattle. The escape from the blacksite. The theft of classified materials. The destruction of the police station. You've been making quite a bit of noise, Mr. Alexeyev. You're all over the news."

"What do you want?"

Bihiniwa stepped closer, his voice low.

"You have information. Information about the American government. About extraterrestrial life. About technologies and secrets that have been hidden from the world."

"And?"

"And we want it. In exchange, we offer you sanctuary. Protection. A new life."

Steven scoffed.

"You want us to defect to the Congo?"

"Not just the Congo. We have allies. Yemen. Iraq. Nations that have been marginalized, exploited, kept in the dark by the West. But with your knowledge… we can change that."

Dmitry stared at him.

"You want to use us."

"We want to level the playing field. The West has hoarded power for too long. It's time for a new order."

Silence.

Dmitry looked at Steven.

Steven shrugged.

"We're dead men walking anyway. Might as well make it count."

Dmitry turned back to Bihiniwa.

"What's the plan?"

Bihiniwa smiled.

"We have a plane waiting. We should leave tonight, law enforcement will find you. We found you easily with a drone after we saw you burn down the police station on the news, so it's only a matter of time before they find you as well."

### V. The Flight South

The private jet lifted off from a remote airstrip just outside Prince Albert at 3:47 AM.

No customs. No questions. Just a sleek Gulfstream with Congolese diplomatic markings and a crew that spoke French and Lingala.

Dmitry and Steven sat in leather seats that reclined almost flat, staring out the window as the frozen Canadian prairies disappeared beneath them.

Steven leaned back, exhaling slowly.

"This is the nicest thing I've sat in since… ever. The SUV was nice too, don't get me wrong... but... I'm still alive! The Pig didn't kill me!"

Dmitry nodded, still processing.

"I can't believe we're actually doing this."

"Believe it, cowboy. We're defectors now. Traitors to the red, white, and blue."
Steven smirked.

The flight attendant brought them food. Real food. Not gas station jerky or canned chili. Grilled chicken, rice, vegetables, fresh bread.

Steven ate like a man who hadn't seen a proper meal in years.

Dmitry picked at his plate, his mind still racing.

"You think they'll actually protect us?"

"The Congolese? Yeah. They need us. We're their golden ticket to exposing the West's bullshit."

"And if the Americans come for us?"

Steven shrugged.

"Then we die in a nicer place than Saskatchewan."

Dmitry laughed despite himself.

The flight took nearly twenty hours, with a refueling stop in Algeria.
The pilot spoke;
>"Please do not leave the plane, we will depart again within an hour."

Steven and Dmitry looked at the desert outside the window for some time, before the plane lifted off again.
By the time they descended into Kinshasa, the landscape had transformed.

Gone were the frozen plains and snow-covered forests.

Below them: lush green jungle, winding rivers, sprawling urban sprawl.

The air was thick and humid when they stepped off the plane.

Steven pulled off his jacket immediately.

"Now *this* is what I'm talkin' about. No more freezing my ass off."

Dmitry felt the warmth on his skin, the weight of the tropical air.

It was strange. Alien, almost. 
"Feels like we are on another dream planet again!"
Dmitry exclamined.

>"We're on planet CONGO BABY!"
Steven excitedly guffawed.

They were driven to a compound on the outskirts of the city. High walls. Armed guards. But inside, it was almost luxurious.

A two-story house with ceiling fans, mosquito nets, a small courtyard with fruit trees, big fountain with a pool. 

Steven walked through the rooms, grinning.

"Dmitry. We got a *house*. An actual house. With beds. And a kitchen. And a bathroom that doesn't smell like a truck stop."

Dmitry stood on the balcony, looking out at the city lights in the distance.

For the first time in years, he felt something close to peace.

"Yeah," he said quietly. "We do."

That night, they sat on the porch, drinking cold beer, eating grapes off a gold platter provided by their hosts.

The air was alive with the sound of insects, distant music, the hum of the city.

Steven leaned back in his chair, feet up on the railing.

"You know what? I could get used to this."

Dmitry smiled.

"Don't get too comfortable. We still have work to do."

"Yeah, yeah. Save the world, expose the conspiracy, all that. But for tonight? I'm just gonna enjoy not being hunted."

Dmitry raised his bottle.

"To not being hunted."

Steven clinked his bottle against Dmitry's.

"To not being hunted."

They sat in silence for a while, watching the stars.

Different stars than the ones they'd seen in Canada.

But stars nonetheless.

Eventually, they went inside.

They entered the common area, grand, fireplace, fountain, beautiful staircase, tapestries and furniture from around the world.

![Fireplace living room](fireplacelivingroom.png)

A TV was on in the corner, playing the news.

Dmitry was about to turn it off when he froze.

The anchor's voice was somber.

"…breaking news tonight. The United States government has confirmed the execution of former NASA Commander Haoyu Zhang, who was convicted of treason, espionage, and conspiracy to incite mass hysteria following the Echofall incident…"

The screen showed a photo of Haoyu. Younger. In his NASA uniform. Smiling.

"…Zhang was executed by lethal injection at 11:47 PM Eastern Time. His final words were not disclosed to the public…"

Steven stood beside Dmitry, staring at the screen.

"…the government maintains that Zhang's claims of extraterrestrial contact were fabricated, and that his actions endangered national security…"

Dmitry's jaw tightened.

Steven's fists clenched.

The anchor continued.

"…Zhang's family could not be reached for comment…"

Dmitry turned off the TV.

The room fell silent.

"They killed him."

"Yeah."

Haoyu was gone.

But his fight wasn't over.

### VI. The Defection

**Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo - Two Weeks Later**

Dmitry and Steven sat in a secure compound, surrounded by armed guards and government officials.

They'd been debriefed for days. Every detail. Every secret. Every piece of classified information they knew.

The Americans. The Russians. The Chinese. The extraterrestrials. The LUCA seed. The Pig. The Oc'Xari. The Avaris.

Everything.

Bihiniwa sat across from them, taking notes.

"This is… extraordinary. If even half of what you're saying is true, it changes everything."

"It's all true," Dmitry said flatly.

"And you destroyed the artifacts? Both of them?"

"Burned them. Along with the barn."

Bihiniwa leaned back, thinking.

"The Americans will deny everything, of course. But with your testimony, with the evidence you've provided… we can expose them."

"And then what?" Steven asked.

"And then the world changes."

**Three Months Later**

Dmitry sat in a newly constructed laboratory in Kinshasa, surrounded by Congolese engineers and scientists.

On the screens in front of him: lines of code. Schematics. Signal protocols.

He'd been working nonstop, rebuilding everything from memory.

The software he'd designed for the Echofall mission. The communication arrays. The deep-space relay systems.

And most importantly: the connection to EON-7b.

The rover was still out there, on Nhexus, dormant but functional.

NASA had abandoned it. Declared the mission a failure. Moved on.

But Dmitry hadn't forgotten.

He typed the final command, his fingers trembling slightly.

"This should do it."

One of the Congolese engineers, a woman named Amani, leaned over his shoulder.

"You're sure this will work?"

"If the rover's still operational, yes. We're bypassing NASA's relay entirely. Direct connection through our own satellite network."

He hit enter.

The room fell silent.

For a moment, nothing.

Then—

A ping.

A signal.

**EON-7b ONLINE**

**STATUS: OPERATIONAL**

**LOCATION: NHEXUS SURFACE - SECTOR 7-GAMMA**

The room erupted in cheers.

Dmitry stared at the screen, tears welling in his eyes.

"We did it. We're back."

Steven, watching from the doorway, grinned.

"You beautiful bastard. You actually did it."

Bihiniwa entered the room, flanked by government officials.

"Mr. Alexeyev. This is… extraordinary. You've just given us access to technology and data that NASA has been hiding for years."

Dmitry turned to him.

"This is just the beginning. With the blueprints I've provided—propulsion systems, life support, communication arrays—you can build your own missions. Your own rovers. Your own spacecraft."

"And you'll help us?"

Dmitry nodded.

"On one condition. You take care of Steven and I. And… there's someone else."

Bihiniwa raised an eyebrow.

"Who?"

"Haoyu Zhang. He was the commander that led the Echofall mission. The American government executed him. We couldn't save him."

Bihiniwa looked at Dmitry, then Steven.
"Ah yes, Haoyu Zhang. The one who was executed for treason. He was all over the news worldwide. I remember him. A brave man."

Dmitry paused, his voice heavy.

"His family… I haven't seen or heard from them since prison. A wife. A son. A daughter. They were torn apart after the raid—separated, scattered. I don't know where they are now."

His voice cracked.

"Get an agent to find them. Track them down, wherever they are. All three of them. Fly them here. Get them a house. A good school for the kids. Good jobs. Reunite them."

"He gave his life for this. For what we're doing. His family deserves better than what they have."

Bihiniwa was quiet for a moment, then nodded slowly.

"We'll bring them here. They'll be safe. They'll be taken care of."

"You have my word."

Dmitry extended his hand.

They shook.

And in that moment, the balance of space exploration shifted.

The Congo was no longer a bystander.

They were the frontline.

**Six Weeks Later**

It had taken Bihiniwa's agents three weeks to track them down.

The wife was found in Albany, New York—alone, barely surviving in a cramped apartment.

The son was located in Los Angeles, living four stories underground in a shoebox apartment, working for a defense AI firm.

The daughter was the hardest to extract—living with an abusive basketball player in St. Louis. The agents had to intervene carefully, but she came willingly once she understood.

Now, a small plane touched down at Kinshasa International Airport.

Three passengers stepped off, looking exhausted, confused, and cautiously hopeful.

Haoyu's wife, still wearing that same cardigan.

His son, clutching a backpack with an anime keychain.

His daughter, no longer in glittery heels, but in simple jeans and a hoodie.

They were met by Congolese agents in crisp suits who escorted them through customs without a single question.

No interrogations. No paperwork. No delays.

They were treated like VIPs.

Outside, a black luxury SUV waited, air-conditioned and pristine.

And standing beside it: Dmitry.

The wife saw him first. Her eyes widened.

"You… you're the one from the ranch. The Russian."

Dmitry nodded.

"Dmitry Alexeyev. I worked with your husband."

Her voice trembled.

"He's… gone..."

"He's gone. I'm sorry. We did everything we could."

She closed her eyes, tears streaming down her face.

The son stepped forward, his jaw tight.

"Why are we here?"

Dmitry looked at him.

"Because Haoyu was my friend. And he died trying to do the right thing. The least I can do is make sure his family is taken care of."

They were taken to a mansion right beside Dmitry and Steven's.
The same gated compound.

A sprawling three-story estate nestled among towering palms and tropical vegetation. Marble floors. Mahogany wood accents. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Congo River in the distance.

Six bedrooms with silk sheets and hand-carved furniture. A chef's kitchen with modern appliances. A private garden with exotic flowers, mango trees, and a crystal-clear infinity pool that seemed to blend into the jungle canopy.

![wifesmansion.mp4](Chapter%2042%20-%20Option%201/wifesmansion.mp4)

The air was thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine.

Birds called from the trees. Monkeys chattered in the distance.

It was paradise.

The wife walked through the rooms, her fingers trailing along the mahogany furniture, the silk curtains, the marble countertops.

She stopped in the master bedroom, staring at the king-sized bed with its embroidered linens.

Tears streamed down her face.

The son wandered to the pool, watching the water shimmer in the afternoon light.

The daughter stood on the balcony, looking out at the jungle canopy and the river beyond.

For the first time in years, she felt safe.

Dmitry stood in the doorway.

"The government will provide for you. The best schools in Kinshasa for the kids. A position at the university for you, if you want it. Or just… time. To heal."

"You'll have staff. A chef. Security. Whatever you need."

"And we're right next door. If you need anything."

The wife turned to him, her voice barely a whisper.

"Why? Why all this?"

"Because Haoyu deserved better. And so do you."

She broke down, sobbing.

The son came in from the pool, his eyes red.

The daughter joined them from the balcony.

They held each other, crying—not just from grief, but from relief.

Dmitry quietly stepped outside, giving them space.

Steven was waiting on the shared courtyard path between the two mansions, smoking a cigarette under a mango tree.

"They gonna be okay?"

Dmitry nodded.

"Eventually."

"You did good, cowboy."

Dmitry looked back at the house.

"It's what Haoyu would have wanted."

### VII. The Revelation

**Year 1 - The Leak**

The Congolese government, along with allies in Yemen, Iraq, and several other nations, released the information to the world.

Not all at once. Strategically. Carefully.

First, the existence of extraterrestrial life.

Then, the cover-ups by Western governments.

Then, the technologies that had been hidden.

And then—the bombshell.

Live footage from EON-7b on Nhexus.

The rover, now under Congolese control, transmitted images that NASA had suppressed for years.

The fossilized flesh pyramids. The geometric gemstone structures. The evidence of the Oc'Xari civilization that the other network relay drones detected, and never released.

They re-created sensor technology to pickup the signal of the Oc'Xari presence still on Earth till this day, leaking that data again to the public.

The world erupted.

Protests. Riots. Governments toppled.

The United States denied everything, but the evidence was overwhelming.

Dmitry and Steven's testimony. Leaked documents. Satellite footage. And now, real-time data from a rover on an alien world.

The truth could no longer be hidden.

**Year 3 - The Space Race Reborn**

The Congo launched its first independent space mission.

Not with American rockets. Not with Russian technology.

With their own.

Built from Dmitry's blueprints. Funded by their mineral wealth. Crewed by Congolese astronauts.

But they didn't do it alone.

The Congo formed the **African Space Alliance**—a coalition with Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia.

Each nation contributed resources, expertise, and personnel.

Rwanda provided advanced computing infrastructure. Kenya offered launch facilities near the equator. Botswana and Tanzania contributed rare earth minerals. Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia provided funding and engineering talent.

Together, they were unstoppable.

The **Lumumba-1** mission reached Mars in record time, establishing the first African research station on another planet.

The mission patch bore the flags of the allied nations, including their supporters from the Middle East.

NASA scrambled to respond, but they were years behind.

The Congo had the data. The technology. The momentum.

And now, they had allies.

Yemen and Iraq followed suit, launching their own missions to the Moon and beyond.

The West, once the undisputed leader in space exploration, was now barely competing.

**Year 5 - The Shift**

The balance of power began to shift.

Nations that had been marginalized for decades suddenly had leverage.

The Congo, with its vast mineral wealth and newfound knowledge, became the technological hub of the world.

Their space agency—**ACSA** (African Consortium for Space Advancement)—surpassed NASA in funding, missions, and discoveries.

EON-7b continued its mission on Nhexus, now sending back gigabytes of data daily.

New rovers were deployed. New planets explored.

The Congo became the frontline of humanity's expansion into the cosmos.

Hungary, Algeria, Tajikistan and Bangladesh, once war-torn and exploited, began trade with the Congo and began to rebuild with advanced technologies reverse-engineered from the leaked information.

The West scrambled to maintain control, but it was too late.

The world had changed.

**Year 10 - The New Order**

A new global alliance formed ; the **Coalition of the Congo**.

Led by the Congo and its African Space Alliance partners.

Together, they demanded transparency, equality, and an end to Western hegemony.

The United Nations was restructured. Power was redistributed.

Security Council seats were added for the Coalition.

For the first time in centuries, the West was no longer in control.

And in space, the flags of the Coalition flew on Mars, the Moon, and soon—Titan.

Not just the Congo's flag. But many others.

Dmitry and Steven watched from the shadows, living under assumed names in their jungle mansion in Kinshasa.

They were heroes to some. Traitors to others.

But they lived well.

Not far from them, in the mansion next door, Haoyu's family had built a new life.

His son worked as a lead engineer for ACSA, helping design the next generation of rovers. He drove a luxury car and lived in comfort his father never knew.

His daughter graduated top of her class from the University of Kinshasa, studying xenobiology. She was engaged to a Congolese diplomat's son.

His wife ran a well-funded community center, helping other displaced families find their footing. She wore fine clothes now, ate well, and smiled more often.

The Congolese government treated them like royalty—honored guests who represented the sacrifice that changed the world.

They never forgot Commander Haoyu Zhang. They built a monument to him in the city center.

**Year 50 - The Legacy**

Dmitry died at the age of 82, peacefully, in his sleep.

Steven outlived him by three years, dying at 85 from complications related to a lifetime of hard living.

They were buried side by side in Kinshasa, their graves constructed with ornate decorated stones. Schools would bring children to pay their respects, to learn what these men have done for their country.

The Coalition of the Congo continued to grow, reshaping global politics for generations.

The entire African continent, united with many allies from Eastern Europe and Asia.

The Coalition became the dominant geopolitical force on Earth.

And the story of Dmitry and Steven ; the janitor and the redneck who burned the gates to other worlds ; became legend.

**Year 100 - The Expansion**

Humanity continued to search the stars.

Led by the Coalition's ACSA, humanity had established permanent colonies on Mars, Europa, and Titan.

Research stations operated by Rwandan scientists. Mining operations funded by Botswana, Bulgaria and Namibia. Engineering teams from Bangladesh, Hungary and Iraq.

EON-7b, still operational on Nhexus, had been joined by dozens of other rovers and probes exploring distant worlds.

**Year 500 - Corruption**

Humans do, what they do best. Greed, corruption, deception.
Politics in Africa became very cutthroat. The generations that built up Africa 500 years ago were long gone. The new leaders of Africa sold their countries away to other competitive nations.

Power juggled between countries, alliances and leaders.

**Year 1000 - The Silence Continues**

Every country on Earth was now a part of the common goal, to reach for the stars.
Space exploration was no longer a competition. It was a collective effort. 

EON-7b had retired, many other countries have landed their probes on Nhexus to survey and collect data. 

Humanity had spread across the solar system. Mars. Europa. Titan. Enceladus. Ganymede.

Humanity did what they have always done - civil wars, political unrest, and all the bullshit of old times started resurfacing again, things were back to normal.
Only now - across many planets.

And that, perhaps, was enough.
