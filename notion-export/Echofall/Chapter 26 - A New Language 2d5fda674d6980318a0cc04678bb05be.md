# Chapter 26 - A New Language

### I. Thread Alphabet

They entered the woven structure with quiet reverence. The air inside felt denser, like being wrapped in warm fabric. The walls weren’t flat ; they *flowed*, as though slowly shifting under an invisible loom. Woven lamps glowed softly overhead.

The Sylvar guides ; graceful, silent ; led them down a hall into what resembled a study chamber. Scrolls and threadbound books lined curved bone-silk shelves. The books were strange ; woven from leathery cloth, their pages made of linen and bark, inked not with liquid but stitched in tight, flowing thread symbols.

One Sylvar stepped forward and handed them a particular book.

It was small. Short. Only a handful of pages.

A children’s book.

No repeated letters. Oversized glyphs. Each symbol was vivid, purposeful, and pulsing with some unknown logic. Even the cover was soft to the touch ; as if the book itself had once been alive.

Dmitry turned pages slowly.

Steven frowned, scratching his head.

“Ain’t got no idea what this says, but that ‘A’ lookin’ thing reminds me of a gator track I once saw in my cousin’s backyard.”

They studied it for over an hour. The Sylvar watched patiently, never interrupting.

Neither man was a linguist. But both were engineers, analysts. They’d spent decades interpreting sensor noise and alien telemetry.

They knew what they were looking at ; or at least, how to learn it.

“It’s a full alphabet,” Dmitry muttered.

“A logic system,” he added. “Mathematical spacing. Positional encoding. Vowel dynamics… It’s *teachable*.”

“Takes me back to decoding Second-Soviet numbers stations.” he added dryly.

“It’ll take months,” Steven said, squinting. “But we’ll get it.”

### II. Guest Quarters

As the woven sun dipped into the silk horizon, the Sylvar silently escorted them across a breezy walkway to a guest home ; an organic structure shaped like a beehive and lotus blossom combined.

Inside was warmth, food- like a plate of gelatin red berries, succulent tofu-like blocks of some strange alien plant and a bottle beholding exquisite flavors of honey, smoke, cedar, and blackberry. In the bedroom were two soft, body-molded living nests that adapted to their posture like memory-foam made of moss.

They sank in without resistance.

The air hummed softly.

Sleep took them without a fight.

### III. Back in the Cells

And just like that…

They woke up back in prison.

Cement. Metal bars. Bleached tile.

Steven blinked.

“Well damn. That was the nicest bed I’ve had since prom night in Tampa.”

### #1: The Macaroni

In the following weeks, no other dreams arose, but they started noticing patterns in their everyday.

At lunch, trays were slammed onto tables.

Dmitry was halfway into his mushy macaroni before he froze.

The pasta… was *arranged*.

Not stacked randomly. Not poured. But placed.

An unmistakable character ; one of the symbols from the children's alphabet book. It curved slightly left, like a sideways tree root.

Steven looked at his tray.

His beans were shaped like another symbol.

“Lex. My lunch is speakin’ Alien-Elvish.”

### #2: The Wall Stain

Another week gone by, as Dmitry sat on his cot, he noticed the stain on the wall beside his bunk.

It’s been there since the day he got in, unchanged.

But now he suddenly recognized it.

A thread letter ; faint, like it had been burned into the paint long ago.

### #3: Reflections

Some more time passed

Steven washed his hands in the sink after dinner. The smudges in the mirror above him… they connected in just the right way.

Another symbol.

A verb, maybe. Or a name.

He stared at it for too long.

### #4: The Shower Scene

On another prison morning, Steven shuffled into the communal shower.

Cold jail shower water. Muffled swearing. Cheap soap.

He cringed, ached and groaned as the cold water hit his back ; then squinted at the drain.

There it was.

A lone pubic hair, sitting perfectly curved, shaped exactly like the 9th letter in the silk alphabet.

Steven burst out laughing.

“LEX!” he shouted, echoing off the tile.

“THE ALIENS ARE WRITIN’ TO ME IN *BALL HAIR!*”

Someone three stalls over muttered, “Jesus Christ…”

Dmitry sat in his bunk, notebook open, pencil worn to the nub.

He had begun sketching the symbols ; all of them ; building a cross-reference. Correlations. Occurrences. Semantic geometry.

Steven leaned in from the next cell, chewing a plastic spoon.

“So… what if this is the aliens’ version of ABCs?”

Dmitry didn’t look up.

“Then we are kindergarteners,” he said.

“And the universe is finally teaching us how to speak.”

### Day 492: The Return of the Dream

It had been over a year and a half since the police raid back in Red’s ranch.

Since the prison walls swallowed them whole.

Since their first step on this silken alien world.

The alphabet of threads had become a secret language between Dmitry and Steven ; whispered over lunch trays, sketched in notebook margins, referenced in the most absurd of places. But as the months dragged on, even those symbols began to fade. Like dreams slipping behind a curtain of apathy.

By day 492, neither of them expected it to return.

But it did.

### IV. Waking Under the Tree

When the dream took them, it was gentle.

No jolt. No alarm. Just the smell of sun-warmed grass and a low breeze curling across skin.

Dmitry opened his eyes first, blinking against the soft golden light.

They were lying beneath a massive oak tree, its leaves rustling above like a lullaby in slow motion. The hill beneath them rolled into soft green folds ; like the Pennsylvania countryside in spring.

“Not thread,” Dmitry  murmured. “Not silk. Real… grass.”

Steven stirred beside him.

“Lex,” he whispered, shielding his eyes from the sun. “Is this heaven or West Virginia?”

Down the hill, a meadow rippled in the light. Pastures stretched lazily toward the horizon. At the base of the valley, small farmhouses dotted the landscape ; each one alive. Made not from wood or brick, but cotton beasts ; massive, gentle creatures with furlike structures that grew into domes and chambers.

Instead of roads, paths of woven reed and dirt trails snaked through the fields.

Forests of real trees bordered the landscape, and in their shade moved Sylver Elves ; not the ones from the Grand Nexus of silk from their initial dream, but simpler, earthier versions. They were barefoot, their robes made of coarse moss-fiber, hands full of berries, herbs, and cloth bundles.

As they spotted the humans, they would scatter, hide, and curiously watch.
