# Chapter 1 - A Frozen Generation

I hope you brought a winter jacket; this place is freezing cold…

## **Trenmor-3**

“Trenmor-3 was cold, and it sucked. Like Mongolia, the land of my ancestors… no, maybe not as bad as Mongolia.
Most seeds landed on planets that weren’t very optimal for life.”

### I. Planet Overview

- **Size:** 0.93 Earth radius
- **Gravity:** 0.91G
- **Atmosphere:** Almost none ; trace methane, sulfur vapor near fissures
- **Surface:** Global crust of permafrost and frozen stone
- **Water:** Trapped beneath thick ice sheets; superheated by geothermal vents
- **Geology:** Extremely thin crust, riddled with rift valleys and deep oceanic faultlines

Trenmor-3 was a planet of silence, frost and isolation. Life thrived deep below, where the crust cracked open and ribbon oceans of boiling black water surged around volcanic chimneys.

### II. Evolutionary Landscape

LUCA’s earliest descendants were extremophiles ; heat-loving microbial life that formed long, sticky mats across geothermal cliffs and cave walls.

These microbes:

- Evolved sheathed membranes for surviving pressure and temperature spikes
- Organized into biofilms with internal logic, distributing nutrients across colonies
- Began forming spiral growth structures, curling in on themselves in Fibonacci-like patterns for efficient space usage

As oxygen was nearly nonexistent, most life on Trenmor-3 used chemosynthesis, pulling energy from sulfides, iron, and basalt crust.

Over hundreds of millions of years, life grew more complex ; but not *larger*.

Instead, it became more organized, like biological architecture.


### III. The Age of Pattern

By ~780 million years post-LUCA, microbial colonies across Trenmor’s deep ocean began behaving increasingly structured.

Colonies exhibited:

- Geometric nesting: circular or hexagonal grid formation, likely for thermal balance
- Memory-linked reproduction: cells would delay division based on past environmental signals
- Signal coordination: entire cliff walls pulsed in bioluminescent waves based on geothermal cycles

Researchers now believe these colonies achieved a form of distributed proto-consciousness ; not thought as we know it, but memory encoded in the rhythm of division and death.

Life lived on this way for millions of years. Never really flourishing, just surviving in tiny heat pockets throughout the planet.

Trenmore-3 was not an uncommon scenario for LUCA life.
