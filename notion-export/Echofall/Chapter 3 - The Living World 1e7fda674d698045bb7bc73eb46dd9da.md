# Chapter 3 - The Living World

This next chapter will explore a biological caste system born not from ideology, but from evolution itself ; a planet where survival branched into value-based anatomy.

This will be a harsh and morally disturbing chapter, echoing the most dehumanizing parts of human history ; but in the cold, indifferent language of evolution.

## Archon

“On **Archon**, 
Evolution branched into purpose, and purpose hardened into hierarchy.
Species ruled by design.
The low were born low. The high were born to lavishly enjoy.
And the rest existed only to keep the machine alive.
**Archon** didn’t fall because it was unjust.
It fell because the biology was tampered with, which eventually resulted in extinction.”

### I. Planet Overview

- **Size:** 1.18 Earth radii
- **Gravity:** 1.12G
- **Atmosphere:** Dense oxygen mix, rich in volatile minerals
- **Seasons:** Highly regular; planetary tilt synced to twin moons
- **Geology:** Volcanic highlands and bioactive floodplains
- **Life Foundation:** Complex, fast-replicating protein chains with specialization triggers ****encoded directly into reproduction

**Archon** was lush, but overactive ; its biosphere constantly forcing life to adapt, refine, stratify.

In time, evolution produced a tiered web.

### II. The Hierarchy of Life

Archon‘s dominant phylum ; *Vireostoma* ; diverged into hundreds of specialized forms. They evolved into integrated roles ; each genetically compelled to serve a niche within a living society.

Over millions of years, that system evolved into castes.

### 1. The Drudgelings - *The Base*

- Function: Organic waste processors, soil aerators, tunnel extruders
- Appearance: A variety of different subspecies serving different purposes, some shaped as building blocks, others as columns, strange animals or low quality kitsch decorations.
- Generally they are mammals; either bald, or hairy, with absorbent folds; some have no eyes or ears, others have multiple
- Traits: High pain tolerance, minimal neural structure
- Reproduction: Sexual organs that plug into other species of the same tier

The Drudgelings lived and died in endless service; bioengineered plumbing that served and swallowed refuse for the civilized, city creatures.

### 2. The Jhummy - *The Food*

- Function: Livestock
- Appearance: The Jhummy were selectively bred the way humans bred wolves into thousands of sub-species of dogs. However, the Jhummy were bred into thousands of sub-species that would have different nutritional values and evolve into every avenue of taste and texture imaginable.
- Traits: All castes would eat this species as a diet. With The Drudgelings feeding off only the least favorable varieties, and the other classes getting different qualities depending on their evolutionary caste ranking.
- Life Cycle: Born in breeding, farming and lab facilities, and slaughtered in a processing factory by Halvons

The Jhummy originally lacked sentience, but some were later bred into specific breeds that were fully self-aware and understood their role - this sentience was seen as a special “flavor profile” by the Valarti Apex Elite. There was something special to them about a fine dining menu at a top of the line luxury restaurant where a menu read “This steak is the finest cut from a Jhummy who lived as a philosopher, writing many books pondering life.” Of course, these special Jhummy *knew* they were livestock.

### 3. The Halvon - *The Laborers*

- Function: Carriers, builders, users of tools, walking beasts of burden
- Appearance: Four-limbed, thick-spined, tusk-jawed bipedals with callused exoskin.
- With extensive surgery, Halvons would be morphed into buildings, bridges, lamp posts, furniture, higher quality art and other “objects”
- Traits: Durable, obedient and bred for different utilities
- Culture: Halvons had a simple language of utterances, communicating basic ideas

The Halvon weren’t slaves by law ; they were slaves by biology.

They *loved their masters*, felt euphoria when praised, and wept of grief when rejected.

### 4. The Zaruu - *The Thinkers*

- Function: Sentience, intelligence, strategists, planners, historians, ethicists
- Appearance: Zaruu start in a humanoid shape in their young age, fully matured Zaruu grow into enormous 7 foot tall square block of flesh and muscle, with a wide stance, waddling to walk
- Traits: High memory capacity, recursive planning logic, not agile or proficient in any sort of physical activity, although they do have muscle, they exercise just by flexing their body on a daily basis
- Reproduction: Rare; they often lived out their lives in hedonism rather than family reproduction lifestyles, thus they would have harems of Halvon slaves that were biologically engineered and surgically altered to be sexually attractive and promiscuous

They knew what they were a part of.

They documented all history including their cruelty with perfect accuracy ; and justified it, with jargon terms like “ethical slavery”, “sustainable servitude”, “collaborative extermination”

A fully matured Zaruu enhanced with latest tech cybernetics, their head has long worn out due to head replacement many decades ago, though they’ve implanted many cybernetic processors acting as brains to keep it alive and more intelligent than ever.

### 5. The Valtari - *The Apex Elite*

- Function: Reproduction, consumption, glutton, inheritance
- Appearance: Towering, crystalline-horned beings with soft, decorative limbs, bipedal humanoids
- Traits: Fully dependent on lower castes; incapable of survival without the other species

Eating the finest exotic foods, drinking the most exquisite drinks, wearing the most extravagant garments. Each Valarti owned a luxurious custom designed mansion surrounded by incredible landscapes, with countless servants fulfilling every need and desire.

### III. The Glutton Age of the Valtari

After eons of endless pleasure living in Eden, the Valartis and Zaruu became bored. 

They wanted some entertainment- they wanted colloseums of gladiators and to torment / bully the under classes 

Zaruu researched bio-engineering technology, creating the Cognition Glands ; viral neuro-enzymes that were surgically implanted into Drudgelings and Halvon alike, rewiring their brains with:

- **Self-awareness**
- **Enhanced Pain comprehension**
- **Memory recall**
- **Moral reflection**

The new generation of Drudgelings were still bottom feeders, still mouth-tethered to sewer flows ; but now they *knew*.

They knew:

- They were born into waste
- They would die unnoticed
- They had no mouths to speak
- No muscles to run
- No hope of evolution

The Valtari watched them break ; physically and spiritually.

They called this The Symphony. The Valarti were very much entertained by their suffering.

Some Valtari forced Drudgelings to recite affirmations:

“I am grateful to serve.”

“I am lowest, and I was made for this.”

“My pain means I am noticed.”

Others made “walkers” ; Drudgelings strapped to mechanical limbs, paraded through festivals to weep in gratitude.

### IV. Collapse: An Unexpected Evolution

The system worked for hundreds of years ; however, the biological mutations which the Apex Elite inflicted upon the lower classes eventually started evolving into unexpected results. The Drudgelings ; *The Base caste* were suddenly no longer born with reproductive organs. The Valari attempted to bio-engineer future generations with reproduction, but their attempts were unsuccessful. They tried creating clones, but they just didn’t work the same way. 

After just a few generations, the lower class went extinct. 

There was no technology to replace their roles, as the world depended on their biology as the technology. So all the other species died out with them.

Waste overflowed, cities and systems collapsed, farms no longer produced.
