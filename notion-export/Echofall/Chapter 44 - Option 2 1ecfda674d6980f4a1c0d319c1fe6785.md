# Chapter 44 - Option 2

### I. The Second Choice - Give the Artifact to the Pig
 
They slowly crept in their SUV past the police station ; just a squat, concrete building wedged between a dental office and a run-down sandwich shop. Only a single cruiser sat out front, rimmed in frost, clearly untouched for hours.

From the dark of their stolen SUV, Steven leaned forward, peering through the windshield.

“I see one guy inside. He’s on the couch… I think he’s sleepin’. Watchin’ some shitty TV show.”

Dmitry nodded grimly, eyes locked on the dim blue flicker coming from the window.

They parked the SUV in the shadows a block away, just beyond the reach of any cameras or street lights.

Inside, they laid their weapons out on the dashboard:

- **The serrated combat knife**, dulled with age but still deadly.
- **The black semi-auto Glock-19**, with two mags Steven tucked into his jacket.
- And the homemade **Mac-10**, now polished, locked, loaded, and ready ; magazine full, bolt open, round chambered, the gun doesn’t even have a safety.

They sat in silence.

The moment felt **heavy**.
The clock of life and death for the universe was ticking.

The cold pressed against the windows. The clock on the dashboard ticked. Somewhere down the road, a dog barked once, then fell silent again.

Dmitry finally broke the silence.

“Alright. Here's how we do it.”

![u8296664269_police_station_night_time_winter_--v_6.1_61c7ae1b-d56c-4325-acc1-4bf937d11ffc_1.png](Chapter%2043%20-%20Option%202/u8296664269_police_station_night_time_winter_--v_6.1_61c7ae1b-d56c-4325-acc1-4bf937d11ffc_1.png)

**The Plan**

He pulled out a folded napkin from the gas station and drew a crude layout of the station, based on their drive-by recon.

“There’s a back door here,” he pointed. “Likely leads to a small hallway. Locker room, bathroom, maybe holding cell. If the artifact’s locked up anywhere, it’s either in evidence… or the armory.”

“Or,” Steven added, “sittin’ on some dumbass desk ‘cause the guy inside thinks it’s just some busted alien banjo.”

Dmitry continued.

“You go around back. Quietly. Wait for me to go in through the front. I’ll draw his attention ; talk my way in, maybe pretend I need help.”

“Then what?”

“Then you sneak in, take him down quietly from behind. We zip-tie him, gag him. Non-lethal if possible.”

Steven raised an eyebrow.

“You want me to do the sneak attack? I’m the loud one, remember?”

Dmitry shrugged.

“Yeah, but you’re also the one with experience sneaking out of your cousin’s trailer during meth raids.”

“Got it, I’ll wrestle down the meth ‘gator.”

“Once he’s down, maybe thirty minutes before anyone even thinks to check in. We find the evidence locker. Grab the guitar artifact. Then we get out. Fast.”

Steven took a long breath. Then double checked under his jacket ensuring the Glock and magazines were secured, and nodded.

“Alright. Let’s rob ourselves a police station.”

Dmitry looked at him, flat-eyed, stuffing the Mac 10 into his waistband.

“No killing. Unless it’s him or us.”

“Got it.”

They opened the doors and stepped into the freezing night.

The wind had picked up. Their breath curled out in steam.

The town slept, quiet as a corpse.

And the clock was ticking.

### **II. The Assault**

**The Break-In was underway**

They were heading to their planned positions - Steven to the back, Dmitry to the front… When unexpectedly came across a side entrance with a much easier entry. Quickly they changed their plans. 

Dmitry tapping Steven, with confusing hand signals - with Steven in disarray as he’s trying to communicate with an alien from outer space before Dmitry *tssk* his tongue and whispers

“This side door is a lot more secluded and should be easier to get through.”

Without a doubt, Steven quietly jimmied the side door open with a crowbar while Dmitry watched the sleeping cop through the window. No alarm. No cameras outside. They crept through the dimly lit hallway, boots silent on the tile.

They found the evidence room-locked with a keypad.

Dmitry had it cracked in 40 seconds.

Confidence grew in both of them, the robbery was going pretty good.

Inside: rows of shelves, lockers, boxes. Dusty. Underused. There were sealed crates marked with alien symbols-an old D.O.D. shipment intercepted long ago and forgotten.

And then-he saw it.

The guitar case. Black. Old. But humming.

“Why is it still here unguarded? How come the CIA never took it back for studies?” Dmitry asked perplexed.

Steven following up “I guess they had more important shit to worry about than some intergalactic banjo.”

Something in Dmitry’s gut twisted. The case vibrated slightly, as if it had a heartbeat.

Steven grabbed it, hoisting it onto his shoulder.

Then came the click.

A deafening *CHIK-CHAK* echoed through the hallway.

They turned-

The cop. Awake. Armed. Point-blank.

“Freeze! DROP IT-”

The shotgun boomed like thunder.

Steven’s head exploded like a piñata. Blood, bone, brain, teeth, eyeballs flying, fragments of the world he once was, sprayed across the concrete wall, and his body collapsing like a heavy bag of potatoes.

Like the world stopped, Dmitrys ears ringing, barely comprehending the situation he just found himself in…

Dmitry screamed; wordless, animalistic. 

Time folded inward. He raised the Mac-10 and emptied the entire magazine into the officer. Muzzle flashes flickered like a strobe in a nightmare. The cop’s body twisted, slammed against the wall, slid down in silence.

Smoke. Blood. The echo of violence.

Steven was gone.

Dmitry stood frozen, gun empty, heart shattered. He stumbled forward, dropped to his knees beside Steven’s body. For a moment; just a moment; he didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

“I’m sorry... I’m so sorry... I’ll bring you back, I promise.” he whimpered, lips numb, shuttering, sobbing, tears rolling down his cheeks.

But the sirens were already wailing, dogs barking in the neighborhood, lights turning on in windows of woken homes by neighbors concerned over the commotion. 

He grabbed the artifact.

Darted out the door.

Lights were already flashing in the far distance; sheriffs called in from neighboring towns. Dmitry drove like a lunatic, drifting through the frozen streets, the guitar on the passenger seat, silent as death, heartbeat pounding louder than firing tank artillery.

He could see Dallas’ old ranch coming up in the headlights.

Police racing behind him.

Tires skidded on ice. The SUV smashed through the old front gate, spun, slammed into the side of the farmhouse.

Smoke hissed from the crumpled hood.

Dmitry grabbed the guitar and bolted from the wreck, sprinting toward the barn.

“STOP!” a voice shouted behind him.

“THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING!”

“WE WILL FIRE-”

He didn’t look back.

The barn doors loomed; wide open, a black mouth waiting in the snow.

Dmitry was nearly there.

Then the shots rang out.

One. Two.

His body dropped into the snow, blood spraying in a crimson fan.

He gasped.

His limbs twitched.

He looks up at the barn door, merely 10 feet from where he fell.

A single silhouette stood within it.

The Pig.

The guitar slipped from his hands, disappearing into the darkness of the barn.

His vision blurred, the world dimming.

The officers ran up behind him, rifles drawn; only to find a dying man in the snow.

No guitar.

No entity.

Just a criminal in a stolen car from Banff who gunned down a cop at the station.

Dmitry’s final thoughts weren’t of the universe.

They weren’t of gods or aliens or Pig.

They were of a bowl of warm borscht his mother made him when he was a child

They were of the gentle Dallas Red who housed strangers at his ranch without question

They were of the exalted, respected Commander Zhang who led the EON-7b rover Echofall project

They were of a cute barista in Golden

They were of a Florida man named Steven.

Who just wanted to fish, drink beer and sit on the beach.

Who would joke about pancakes and alligators.

The pubic hairs in the shower resembling one of the Sylver alphabetic letters.

The way the sunlight felt that day in Banff.

And as the light faded, he knew in his heart - that he held up the deal - the pig promised - that time would roll back, and he would be re-united in harmony with his friends, back when they were young, in the old nostalgic warmth of how the world used to be. 

Then everything went dark.

### **III. Annihilation**

Later That Same Night

The cosmos shifted.

It wasn’t with a bang, or flash, or great explosion.

It was quiet.

*Too* quiet.

Across the spiral arms of the galaxy, the Oc’Xari; the watchers, the passive wanderers, the cosmic spyware; were erased. One by one. Then by the thousands. Then all at once. A silent extinction, not of flesh, but of data, of presence, of memory. They didn’t scream. They didn’t even know. They simply ceased.

The artifact had been brought to the barn on Red’s Ranch, which was some sort of energy portal that the Oc’Xari and the Entity could use to interact with physical reality. Blood had been spilled. The terms had been *mostly* met.

Mostly… because the Pig… *did not keep his word. He said it himself in fine print; his interactions with LUCA origins was limited. Of course he wasn’t able to turn back time… what a bluff to be eaten by the ignorant gullible desperation of humans trying to save the ones they love and hold dear.*

Dmitry and Steven laid to rest.

Shot down in a small prairie town by simple police officers who would never understand what they’d been part of.

Commander Haoyu Zhang had been executed at Mississippi Supermax.

His children? Fatherless. His wife? Husbandless. Their minds fractured by grief and confusion.

Dallas Red? Still rotting behind the steel bars of a government blacksite, the Oc’Xari song long faded from his heart.

The world forgot and moved on.

And in the distant skies of the unspoiled, a planet untouched by lies, war, or infestation, the Avaris sat alone at the same obsidian-glass table where the meeting had taken place just nights earlier; though time and distance meant little to beings as old and far-reaching as they.

The seat once held by the Pig was empty.

So too the one for the Oc’Xari.

And the chairs where the mortal humans once sat.

Only the Kavariin remained.

His feathers shimmered softly in the candlelight of ornately decorated wax sculptures with gently burning wicks.

His great wings were folded neatly behind his back. His talon-graspers rested on the polished surface of the table, gently tapping a rhythmic pattern that echoed into the vast silence.

A warrior? No. He was something else.

A philosopher.

A cartographer of meaning.

A sentinel of stillness.

And he thought.

The laws of the universe are... not fair.

![u8296664269_user_character_reference_to_put_him_at_an_elegant_61f05f2b-6fbb-4734-8500-74daf743b55e_1.png](Chapter%2043%20-%20Option%202/u8296664269_user_character_reference_to_put_him_at_an_elegant_61f05f2b-6fbb-4734-8500-74daf743b55e_1.png)

He had lived long enough to remember the sound of wind across molten cliffs when his world was young.

He had seen flowers bloom from extinct soils engineered by gentleness.

He had witnessed death, rebirth, extinction; and *evolution by will*.

But this?

This was something new.

Was the Pig a god? Or a parasite that mistook vengeance for stewardship?

Were the humans players of fate? Or merely thrown into a fire lit long before they were born?

He closed his eyes.

He could still see the look in Dmitry’s eyes in the dream-realm; *not of power, or hope, or control;* but of desperation. Of a simple man, a pawn, caught between cosmic chessmasters, forced to move a piece that was never his to hold.

“The Creator broke his own rules,” the Kavariin whispered aloud, voice echoing across empty chairs.

“And the mortals paid the price.”

He rose from the table, talons clinking softly.

Outside his sky-temple, the wind howled in the high canopy.

Above him; stars. Too many to name. Too many to grieve.

But he raised a winged arm and scribed a note into a scholarly scroll; glowing glyphs suspended on the fine parchment.

“They tried. And that must be remembered.”

Then he turned, vanished into the upper sanctum of his temple, where no eyes followed.

And the table was empty once more.

### **IV. Oblivion**

Centuries passed like dust caught in sunlight. Five hundred years dissolved into history’s blind spot, and what once ignited riots, courtrooms, invasions, and prophecy had faded into rumor; then to legend.

All records of Nhexus “the hoax planet”, the Oc’Xari "hoax invasion," the legendary Commander Haoyu Zhang, the explosive media trials, the protests, the executions; swept under the rug by bureaucracy and time.

The world moved on.

Haoyu’s great-great-grandchildren were born. They lived ordinary lives, and died ordinary deaths. Their own children forgot his name. By the fifth generation, Haoyu Zhang was no more than a smudge in old legal archives, a ghost lost in cold storage cloud servers no one accessed anymore.

Dallas Red’s ranch has long been demolished, urbanized. The town of Swift Current has since become a metropolitan city, with a 12 story tall condo sitting where the barn once stood. 

The universe returned to silence.

The Echofall EON-7b rover still rests, covered in dust on the surface of Nhexus, the empty forgotten planet of suffering and slop where not even ghosts roam the ancient, fossilized flesh pyramids. No satellite pinged Oc’Xari, nothing again ever discovered the countless geometric gemstone structures littered across the planet. The stars once watched by terrified eyes were left without an audience.

And in the high-altitude sanctuaries of Avaris, the Pig never returned. It did not need to. There was nothing left to cleanse. The Kavariin, born of the original seed of nature, had never deviated from their sacred restraint. The Oc’Xari, that parasitic web of curiosity and quiet invasion, was gone-exterminated in a silent act of cosmic bleach.

The worlds of Earth, Ferron, Serica; they withered, each in their own time.

Great filter events occurred inevitably. 

Entropy. 

The Kavariin historians; the few who still bothered to write books; preserved a story. A minor one which wouldn’t be read by many. Not at the center of their theology or politics, but still remembered by niche history buffs:

From the ancient planet Earth, far away at the other end of our galaxy
Two men, lost and tired.

Dmitry Alexeyev and Steven Young.

Confused heroes who made a deal with the God of Decay.
With one desire - to save their friend, and bring their world back to harmony.
Naive and innocently pitiful.
Betrayed, and left for dead.

And through time, they vanished into myth and legend.

Many more facts and stories unveiled after deep research, and were compiled by intergalactic Kavariin librarians into this very book titled “  **Echofall**  “

Life clung to the galaxy like dew to dying leaves, struggling to persist.

And after another hundred billion years, the last lungs stopped breathing. The last planet cooled. The last blade of engineered grass gave up its coded photosynthesis.

Earth long ago fell silent.

The doors of the Chuckwagon Cafe have long closed.

Ferron has long collapsed into civil war and flame.

Serica, even with its living threads, unraveled.

Even Avaris; the pristine; fell to time. Not to violence. Not to decay. Just to the laws of what *is*.

And all that remained was the Pig.

Though, by then, it was no longer a Pig.

The Pig was a shape, a form. A necessary mask.

Now, it was something else.

It was... nothing.

Yet it was everything.

Outside of time.

Outside of space.

Outside of law, mass, entropy, or light.

It simply was:

The flies that fed on rotting corpses.

The mushrooms that devoured decaying wood.

The bleach that sterilized dirty kitchen floors in a restaurant.

The cancer that erased the flawed.

It was not a villain.

It was not a god.

It was the universe, living out it’s natural cycle, like an engine designed to do so.

And so it did.

The universe glimmered on - until it's final dying star, before fading into oblivion.
