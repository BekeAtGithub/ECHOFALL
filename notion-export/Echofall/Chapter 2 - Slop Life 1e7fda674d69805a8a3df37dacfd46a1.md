# Chapter 2 - Slop Life

If you have a weak stomach - perhaps, skip this chapter.

This story is heinous, putrid and slow.

"Most LUCA-seeded planets died because life was too slow, too fragile, or too bold.
On Nhexus however, life flourished… but it shouldn’t have. 
The seed was damaged, and there was probably something wrong with the planet, too."

## Nhexus - The Slop Planet

### I. Planet Overview

- **Size:** 1.05 Earth radius
- **Gravity:** 0.96G
- **Atmosphere:** Ammonia-thick, caustic vapor pockets, acidic rainfall
- **Temperature:** Moderate but chemically unstable
- **Surface:** Soft, spongey terrain; prone to organic rot crusts
- **Oceans:** Shallow toxic brine seas laced with dissolved proteins and alcohols

Nhexus began like many LUCA worlds ; fertile, warm, chemically diverse.

But at the molecular level, life was already unclean.

### II. The Age of Slop

### ~100–800 million years post-LUCA

This LUCA Seed must have been flawed in production… or perhaps tainted during it’s trip to Nhexus.

Early life crawled from mucosal brine pits and formed squirming blankets across swamp-crusts littered with all types of insects.

These organisms lacked structure. They often:

- Vomited excess proteins their cells couldn’t fold correctly
- Grew half-formed limbs that detached and rotted
- Never grew rectums to expel waste, so it would often come back out through their mouths.

Those that grew larger:

- Developed skull-walls that never closed, leaving brains partially exposed, being vulnerable to all sorts of parasites, diseases and plagues
- Grew eyes that faced in random directions, causing them to experience disorientation.
- Some used tongues to move-like snakes, dragging themselves by taste muscle

Each lineage became only more ridden with evolutionary failures.

### III. Pre-Slop Evolution

Around Year 900M, Nhexus entered its pre-peak peak of complexity.

The most “successful” clade were the Pre-Slops:

- These creatures created small buildings by vomiting sludge that would harden. They would regurgitate layers upon layers to create structures.
- Slops often died during reproduction, their bodies would often break apart, resulting in a spawning pool with dozens of new Slops to live out their bleak existence of suffering.

Competing fauna included:

- A variety of Crabs: This planet also evolved into many species of crabs which thrived in slop swamp pools and brine pits
- Lurch-Buds: plants spread spores, which grew into all sorts of bizarre flora
- One species, the Crawling Shiver, would constantly scream ; not in pain, but as an accidental output of their sensory nerves brushing against internal teeth-like growths in the chest cavity.

### IV. The Gut-War Epoch

Multiple proto-sentient lifeforms branched out in peak complexity from the Pre-Slop species, massive battles emerged due to the differences between the sub-specimen factions;

### *The Spine-Lanterns:*

- These bio-mechanical organisms glow from their own spinal fluid, which acted as light sources. 
- Spine-lanterns would develop tube organs encased in hard carapace shells. They would use the tubes to connect to other Spine-Lanterns, creating a network of nutrients and information.
- They would engulf other species, liquify them, and pump their remains into a pool.

### *The Djormo:*

- A big brute, bear-like species, though a lot more hideous.
- Would terrorize many other living organisms throughout the planet, luckily would not breed often.

### *The Ossari:*

- Developed intelligent skeletal brains, not a brain inside a skull, but a brain entangled as a nerve-gland system throughout their body ; understanding concepts of curiosity, and serving a greater purpose for their communities
- Reproduced by building walls from organic material, the males would then ejaculate all over the walls, where the females came to impregnate themselves on the wall
- The Ossaris bodies could morph together with large quantities of Ossari into “Flesh Structures” they would form grotesque pyramids, obelisks, houses and even megastructure’s such as skyscrapers which would house a variety of species on the planet. Once a building would be formed - they would slowly start to die as their skin would harden, and fossilize in place. A notable megastructure/sloptech was a gigantic scope with a thousand eyes bulging out towards space - like a space observatory - they would study the stars the way humans would.
- The Ossari would also be known to morph families together into vehicles serving as logistics transportation

### *The Slops:*

- The Slops mentioned from earlier lived on and eventually evolved proboscis mouthparts that injected parasitic slop into others to control them
- This evolution was crucial to the slops becoming the dominant species - using their new biology as a weapon to enslave the other species to provide for the Slops
- The parasites they’d inject into other species, would eventually evolve to also infect the Slops who started the parasites, and eventually these parasites formed a flesh hivemind and dominated the planet before dying out due to the Great Sludge Storm

### V. The Great Sludge Storm

In its final million years:

- The skies turned dark from ammonia clouds.
- Superstorms began violently creating tsunamis, tornados and hurricanes of sludge, ravaging large portions of the planet
- A megapyramid was built by the Ossari, attempting to reach the stars.
- These storms are thought to have been a reaction caused by their home sun collapsing and fading into a white dwarf, because after some time- the storms stopped suddenly as the atmosphere of Nhexus faded - not completely but enough for weather and life to die out

Many who study this planet believe the Great Sludge Storm was the best event that happened in the universe… They wish it would have come sooner to lay mercy and peace upon this horrific abomination of misfortunate evolutionary mutations.

### VI. Legacy

Once the sludge storm has passed - the air cleared, and the sludge washed away, the atmosphere of the planet has mostly died, and for over hundreds of thousands of years - not a single wind storm swept the lands, no weather, no storms, thus; all fossils and remnants left over from the storm have been perfectly preserved.
