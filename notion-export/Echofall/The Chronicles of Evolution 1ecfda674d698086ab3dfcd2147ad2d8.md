*An Unofficial Cultural and Evolutionary Record of LUCA-Origin Worlds*

Compiled 102.3 Billion Years Post-Seeding

Written by an Avaris Historian; Adam Marton Beke.

Disclaimer:

As you begin this book, keep one truth in mind:

Not all of the species you are about to encounter are truly *alien*.

They were not born of separate origins.

They, like you, were shaped from the same ancient seed ; LUCA.

These are your distant cousins.

Forgotten branches on the same tree.

And though their worlds were strange, their struggle was not.

What you’re about to read is not just history.

It’s ancestry.

These stories aren’t just about them.

It’s about us.

"With over a thousand LUCA-seeded planets where life bloomed and eventually died, there is simply too much to record in one volume.

Amongst the historical council of intergalactic librarians, we’ve voted and agreed to include just a few of the most bizarre, meaningful, heroic, and beloved worlds to highlight in this historical book.

Some burned brightly before their end. Others never had a chance. But all are worth remembering."
