# Chapter 7 - Threadscapes

### **Serica**

“The great tailors of the universe

Weaving magnificent, exquisite threads.

Cities woven of extravagant patterns.”

- **Name**: Serica (self-designated)
- **LUCA Seed Code**: Origin 058Y-Ji
- **Gravity**: 0.95G
- **Climate**: Mild, humid, and soft; no extremes
- **Biosphere**: Dense with silk-producing flora and fauna; major predators fell extinct in early eras
- **Civilization**: Sentient silk-weavers who form buildings, vehicles, and infrastructure with their own bodies and fibers

### **II. The People:**

### **The Weavers of Serica**

The diverse breed of animal species, known simply as Weavers, are soft-bodied, thread-producing beings with long, flexible forms. They:

- Produce all sorts of fibers, cloths, leathers, and silks
- Communicate via vibrations and pigment-thread messages
- Build, move, and even become their cities
- Link together physically to form bridges, towers, and living transport

They have no hard bones, no desire for violence, and no sense of individual property. Everything is shared, spun, and sustained ; all driven by a collective memory of peace and balance.

### **The Sylver - Elvenkind of the Loomed Wilds**

Living in symbiosis with the Weavers are the Sylver ; a delicate, humanoid race of tall, bioluminescent beings, who resemble the mythical elves of ancient Earth in shape and bearing. They:

- Have elongated ears, soft-vined hair, and eyes like flowing water, many having parts of nature growing out of them, like smaller sticks, branches, and flowers
- Work away on farms, producing food for the weavers and themselves
- Are exceptional fashion designers - the entire world is outfitted in exquisite quality clothing, quilting, and extravagant trinkets
- They soak threads in an epoxy type material to create harder objects such as plates, cutlery, farming equipment, and other useful items
- Possess silken skin that changes hue with emotion
- With their own alphabet, their spoken language sounds of cellos, harps and flutes - still with consonants and vowels.

The Sylver are not the builders of Serica ; but its dreamers, diplomats, and lore-keepers. They preserve cultural memory, guide social harmony, and communicate with other factions within their world, through woven resonance songs.

They live in cities, countryside and in aerial communities ; silk-orchards strung between trees like canopy ; and raise orchid-foxes, glowhoppers, and sunweave-moths.

Together, the Weavers and Sylver maintain a world without conquest. A place where architecture breathes, art lives, and society hums on cooperation, not control.

### **III. Society and Culture**

Serican society is fluid, artistic, and collective:

- No currency or written language
- Knowledge passed via woven tapestries, songs, and living memory
- Communities knit daily life together through mobile villages, sky-creature riding, and dancing cities
- Art is woven, sung, and performed with entire bodies ; buildings are living murals
- Festivals are web-wide musical events, strummed across entire villages

They live in peace with their environment, growing food on rooftops and homes that bloom like flowers.

### **IV. Technology and Infrastructure**

No metals, no wheels, no engines. Serica’s tech is:

- 100% biological
- Symbiotic creatures used as floating ships, ambulatory caravans, and lighting systems
- Massive silk cities hang from trees, drift on oceans, or crawl on beasts’ backs
- Architecture constantly re-weaves itself with the help of the community
- Roads are unrolled silk; bridges are woven in minutes by volunteer citizens, when they aren’t being used, they are retracted, deconstructed, built on demand

Mega-structures like the Grand Nexus and Cloud Stair exist, built by thousands of weavers knotting and entangling into one living being.

### **V. An Age of Stagnation**

Despite their brilliance, Serica is far from perfect:

- Knowledge fades as tapestries decay and oral tales are forgotten
- Innovation slows; new ideas are rare, old marvels irreplicable
- Without durable archives, they lose the past one thread at a time
- Few pursue science or deep inquiry ; comfort has replaced curiosity
- Some elders now attempt memory symbionts and knot-libraries to stop the rot
- Once in their history, there was an anomalous blip ; an entity, appeared upon the planet. It made a deal with a merchant, leaving behind an artifact: a gold roped necklace with a pendant shaped like a pyramid that granted magnificent luck to its wearer at the cost of misfortune to all they touched.
    
    The necklace has been locked up and protected in a museum, and generations have passed down the tale of a demonic entity resembling a pig ; a fairy tale legend on Serica, known by both Weaver and Sylver.
    

### **VI. Status**

Serica survives ; elegantly, beautifully, vulnerably.

“The snobbiest of fashion connoisseurs, could only dream of such fine taste.”
