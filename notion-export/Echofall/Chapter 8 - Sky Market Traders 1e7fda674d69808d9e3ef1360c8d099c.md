# Chapter 8 - Sky Market Traders

**Kavariin**

“Kavariin - a planet of rich life which precedes the LUCA Seed, existing far before “The Ancient Ones”- of this books Prologue.
Born of predators, the Avaris could have ruled by fang and talon.
But they chose trade, not war.
Culture, not conquest.
The Great Skies, Sun and Stars.”

### I. Planet Overview

- **Name:** Kavariin (self-designated)
- **LUCA Seed Code:** N/A - not a LUCA related planet - entirely different genetic pattern
- **Size:** 1.09 Earth radii
- **Gravity:** 0.94G (ideal for flight)
- **Atmosphere:** Rich in oxygen and trace aromatics; supportive of both powered and biological flight
- **Climates:** Diverse ; thick jungles, crimson deserts, polar spires, and canopy-covered archipelagos
- **Moons:** Two ; gentle tidal interactions; primary moon used as a creative sanctuary

<A city designed to inspire wonder, awe and reflection>

### II. The Species: The Avaris

The Avaris were descended from dominant aerial predators ; six-limbed vertebrates with:

- Massive feathered wings, diverse in colors, shapes and patterns, as well as arms with hands, and bipedal with legs and feet
- Talon-graspers at mid-wing joints, allowing for fine manipulation of tools, instruments, and surgical devices
- Advanced vocal range capable of harmonizing in multiple frequencies at once
- Complex binocular and thermal vision, refined during their ancestral hunting epochs

Despite being born killers, their predatory past did not define their future.

What separated the Avaris from the others wasn’t intelligence ; it was morality and social maturity as their culture and politics progressed

### III. Evolution Into Omnivory - The Ethical Revolution

The Avaris retained their carnivorous biology well into early civilization.

But as their culture matured, they began asking questions:

- “Why must sentience come from suffering?”
- “Can we not evolve what nature failed to perfect?”
- “Is taste a cruelty, or just chemistry?”

Their answer: bio-directed evolution.

Through deliberate gene editing, they transitioned to omnivory ; enhancing digestive efficiency, minimizing energy waste, and expanding their gustatory palate. Then came the true breakthrough:

A global embrace of lab-grown flesh.

### IV. The Lab-Meat Renaissance

They perfected cultured meat far beyond human attempts ; to the point that:

- Wagyu-tier fibers were replicated precisely through genetic tuning of tension thresholds
- Brisket-style fat distributions were engineered from vat-grown lipid chambers
- Ribs, loins, and tendons were layered mechanically to create pull-apart satisfaction
- Flavors could be programmed ; from smoky to gamey to spiced ; without harming a single living thing

These living taste sculptures were crafted not in slaughterhouses, but in culinary art labs ; run by chefs and biochemists, not butchers.

### V. Rewilding the Planet - No More Farms

With meat, textiles, and proteins synthesized:

- No farmland was needed
- Grazing lands were reforested
- Oceans were no longer fished, only studied and celebrated
- Entire valleys once cleared for crops became cultural sanctuaries

Their cities were woven into cliffs, floating on thermal updrafts, or suspended from massive skyroots.

Instead of supermarkets and grain silos, each district had a flavor cathedral - part restaurant, part theater, part sculptural garden.

There, Avaris flocked not to consume, but to commune.

### VI. Society of the Sky

The Avaris built their civilization on abundance and movement:

- Trade networks formed between floating platforms and sky-harbors
- Knowledge temples offered free education in philosophy, song, and flight choreography
- Art sanctuaries dotted across the planet’s most scenic regions, where citizens were encouraged to perform, paint, invent, or simply be witnessed

With scarcity eliminated, the primary motivators became:

- Recognition
- Beauty
- Legacy

Avaris no longer asked *“What do I own?”* but *“What did I create that others will remember?”*

### VII. Deep Space Harmony

Once deep-space mining was fully automated, resources were extracted without cost, or labor - and only polluting, mining, and producing mass factories.

Terraforming projects began on:

- **Tethra** (moon of the outer gas giant ; turned into a polar spa-temple)
- **Maazari** (small inner planet ; converted into a massive wing-dance amphitheater)
- **Cloudstone** (orbital station of frozen gas-petals, home to scent poets and acoustic sculptors)

Avaris citizens could request their own homes on each planet, custom designed and freely given through public consensus.

Apply. Be approved. Receive.

No debt. No ownership.

Only place and purpose.

### VIII. Still Alone - But Still Looking

The Kavariin is one of the original planets in the designed universe, and the Avaris are just as ancient as the Ancient Ones who created the LUCA Canon.

The Avaris are pre-LUCA life, unrelated to the synthetic seed.

Despite having mapped every object in their solar system, contacted no one, and discovered no alien artifact, the Avaris continued to search the stars.

They sang transmissions into the void.

They left feather-scribed sky-prayers on asteroids.

They painted orbital murals using solar-reflective nanogel, just in case someone was watching..

Never found Earth.

Never knew of the ancient ones, or the LUCA, or the Oc’Xari, or anything.

Never knew what they’d survived.

As far as the Avaris knew- they were the only species in the universe, and they still have yet to discover the origins of how life began on their own planet.
