# Chapter 33 - Decay

### Another Round at the Chuckwagon

As an experienced Forensic Psychologist, Dr. Jennifer Lynn knew a mental condition like this was borderline impossible, especially for a man who was a dignified Commander from the age of 30.

Lynn sat in her car, engine ticking in the silence of the underground parking garage, unable to shake the memory of Haoyu Zhang’s eyes; the way his voice shifted, the clarity that surfaced before it was dragged back into madness.

That pig he kept rambling about…

**The Chuckwagon Café.**

Lynn opened her laptop at home, steam rising from a bowl of instant noodles she barely touched. A quick search led her to it: a real place. Tucked away in a quiet little town called Diamond Valley, Alberta. Population barely 5,000. A tiny roadside stop in the middle of vast Canadian prairie-lands.

It was real.

And something about that fact; about *him* naming something that actually existed; made her feel colder than anything he’d said in that padded room.

Lynn filed a travel request the next morning under investigative grounds.

Her team didn’t ask many questions.

Within seventy-two hours, she was behind the wheel of a rented sedan, watching wheat fields roll by under an open blue sky. It was winter. The prairies dry, not much snow, the clouds drifted like lazy cattle.

She arrived just past noon.

The gravel crunched beneath her tires as she pulled into the Chuckwagon Café’s lot; just three cars in the whole place. She sat still for a moment, before she turned the key, stepped out, and closed the door with a quiet *thunk*.

The cold wind met her immediately; it was hard to adjust to, coming from Mississippi.

The café looked exactly like what the name promised. A squat, homey diner with faded red trim, a wooden porch, and a large sign overhead in big, looping letters: *Chuckwagon Café*. A horseshoe was bolted above the door.

Jennifer Lynn climbed the steps slowly, eyes sweeping across the details; the old license plates nailed to the siding, the frozen flowerpots, the sticker-covered window.

She stepped inside.

A soft jingle of a bell above the door announced her arrival.

Inside was quiet, except for the faint hum of a country ballad playing from a jukebox in the corner and the clink of a spoon in a ceramic mug.

From behind the counter emerged a cheerful woman in her mid-thirties, blonde hair tied back in a loose ponytail, apron dusted with flour.

“Hi there, welcome in! Just one today?”

Jennifer nodded.

“Yes. Just one.”

“Grab any seat you like, sweetie. I’ll be right over with a menu and some coffee.”

Jennifer slid into a booth by the window, taking in the room. Old photographs hung on the walls, prairie sunsets, horses, a few black-and-white rodeo shots from decades past.

Moments later, the hostess returned with a mug of coffee and a practiced smile.

“Here you go; house blend. Strong enough to wake a mule.”

Jennifer smiled faintly.

As the hostess turned to walk away, Jennifer cleared her throat and reached into her jacket, flipping open her badge with quiet precision.

“Excuse me… I’m a federal agent. Just doing a bit of follow-up on a closed file.”

She slid a worn photograph across the table; an old ID shot of Haoyu Zhang.

“Have you ever seen this man?”

The waitress blinked, tilting her head. At first, confusion. Then a squint.

She leaned forward slightly, examining the picture.

“Hmm… I’m not sure. Looks sorta familiar but…”

She trailed off, eyes drifting upward in thought.

Then it hit her.

“Wait-actually, yeah. Yeah, I think I did see him. Years ago now. Maybe even a decade? He came in alone, seemed real tense. Sat right there-” she pointed to a corner table. “Kept checking his watch, like every minute.”

Jennifer stayed silent, taking it in.

“Then like 10 minutes before the cafe closed, this cowboy guy shows up-real weathered lookin’, denim shirt, maybe in his sixties. They barely ordered anything. Slammed their coffee, left a fat tip, and took off like the place was on fire.”

“Why? Was he in trouble?”

Jennifer looked down at the photo again. Her voice soft.

“Confidential.”

The waitress nodded, then smiled.

Jennifer Lynn ordered the all-day breakfast. Eggs, toast, some kind of local sausage that smelled faintly of sage. It was yummy… comforting, in that heavy prairie kind of way. As she ate, she scanned the café slowly. Not just glancing, but *really* looking.

There was nothing out of the ordinary.

Just a regular little roadside diner.

No signs of madness. No ancient carvings. No weird vibes.

Just coffee, cowboy photos, and a squeaky ceiling fan spinning lazy circles overhead.

Halfway through her plate, she excused herself to use the bathroom.

The hallway was short, narrow, and smelled faintly of pine cleaner. She stepped into the single-occupant restroom and closed the door behind her, twisting the old bronze latch until it *clicked*.

She relieved herself, flushed, and stepped up to the sink.

White porcelain. Warm water. Faint hum of old plumbing.

She turned the tap off… and looked up to meet her reflection.

Only… there was no mirror.

Instead, mounted directly above the sink, was a **gilded gold picture frame**, thick and ornate, encrusted with tiny patterns of swirls and laurel leaves like something pulled from the Versailles palace.

But inside the frame was no landscape. No western painting.

It was a **portrait**.

A man; no, a *figure;* seated in an impossibly elegant throne. Black tuxedo. Crisp bowtie. white gloved hands resting on armrests carved from precious metals.

But the **head** was all wrong.

Not human.

**A pig.**

A pig’s head. Furry, with fangs, massive horns. Its eyes; those *eyes*; not part of the painting’s texture. They looked real, reflective, wet, alive. Like holes cut out of the canvas with a real beast behind it. 

And they were looking at her.

Not past her.

**At her.**

Jennifer froze.

Her breath caught in her throat, hands dripping over the sink.

It felt like something had entered the room; like the temperature had dropped five degrees.

The air tightened, pulled into a vacuum.

She blinked once. Twice.

Still there.

The pig’s gaze didn’t waver. Its posture remained perfect. That tuxedo; it looked expensive. Tailored. Ancient and timeless all at once.

Her pulse quickened.

She backed out slowly; one step, then two; never turning her back, not until she was fully in the hallway again. Only then did she exhale, chest trembling.

She returned to the front, walked up to the counter.

“Hey,” she said carefully to the waitress. “What’s with the painting in the bathroom?”

The woman looked up from wiping a mug.

“Painting?” she said, puzzled.

“Yeah,” Jennifer nodded. “Of the pig. In a tuxedo. On a throne.”

The waitress squinted, genuinely confused.

“I’m… not sure? That’s strange.”

She frowned, wiping her hands on her apron.

“Hang on.”

She walked down the hallway, pushed open the restroom door, and peeked inside.

“Huh…”

Her voice trailed off.

“That is weird. I used the bathroom this morning. There was a mirror there. Like, for sure.”

She stepped inside to check more closely.

“Looks expensive… Maybe the owner came in and swapped it out? But I never saw any other staff come and go today. I don’t know.”

She shrugged, genuinely baffled.

Jennifer watched her, quiet. The air felt off again. And somehow the hallway looked weird now… it wasn’t different, but it held something *just slightly* out of phase with reality.

“Probably just a prank,” the waitress offered with a shaky laugh. “Small towns, right?”

“Right…” Jennifer murmured.

She returned to her booth. Finished her breakfast with a little less appetite… staring at the hallway as it just seemed like it wasn’t real anymore.

Paid in cash.

Left quietly.

As she stepped outside, the cold winds had picked up. The prairie breeze now carried a scent she couldn’t place; like iron and oil.

She looked back at the café once more.

And wondered what else Haoyu had been right about.

She opened the driver’s side door, slid in, and pulled it shut with a soft **thunk**.

Keys in the ignition.

Click.

She turned it over.

The engine started with a low grumble; and the radio came on with it.

Mid-sentence. Deep. Gravelly. An evil voice spoke deep within her soul.

“I know you’re looking for me… if I were you, I’d stop.”

Jennifer froze.

Her hand on the key.

The voice was slow. Measured. Ancient in tone, but not dated.

It filled the cabin, louder than it should have been. Unmistakable.

Then; like a tape skipping; another voice cut in.

“And that, folks, was the villain’s big moment from the 2047 psychological thriller The Hollow Quiet. Great flick. We’ll be back after this quick break-”

Light guitar music played.

Jennifer sat there, unmoving.

A chill crept up her arms. She reached for the dial and turned the volume down; but not off. Her fingers hovered for a moment.

She replayed the sentence in her head.

It *was* a movie quote. She even remembered it now that the host had said the title.

But something was wrong.

The timing. The *way* it had hit.

Like the voice hadn’t come from the radio at all, but from something deeper; *through* the speakers.

*To* her.

She looked out the windshield at the Chuckwagon Café.

Still just a diner.

Still just a dusty gravel lot.

But the longer she sat there, the more that single sentence rang in her skull.

“I know you’re looking for me… if I were you, I’d stop.”

She put the car in gear.

And didn’t say a word the entire drive back.

She returned to Mississippi the next morning, silent through the airport, quiet on the shuttle, numb in the elevator as the doors closed around her and sealed her back into the sterile hum of her daily world.

A crisp form sat neatly on her desk, stamped and signed.

**Authorization: Special Site Reconnaissance – Case File Omega-Xi-Seven**

Approved.

She stared at it.

Everything in her report had been green-lit: her travel, her expenses, the rationale to investigate the Chuckwagon Café.

Her findings section was blank, waiting.

And she filled it in with shaking fingers:

"Site visited.

Observed subject location.

No anomalous activity.

No further action required."

No mention of the painting.

No mention of the mirror that wasn’t there.

No mention of the radio.

She clicked submit.

It was easier that way.

Better to be sane than right.

And just like that; it was over.

Filed. Forgotten.

The Chuckwagon Café was marked as *ordinary,* and Haoyu Zhang marked as *insane.*

And it was never spoken of again.
