                <h1>Chapter 36 - British Columbia</h1><h3><strong>I. Kelowna, BC</strong></h3><p><strong>13:43 - Day One</strong><p>The plan was simple. A straight shot east through British Columbia. About 300 kilometers to the next major city; Kelowna. They expected to arrive within three hours.</p><p><p>Instead, it took them seven.</p><p><p>By hour two, the Coquihalla Highway revealed its true nature ; a serpent of black ice and fog-choked turns winding through sheer cliffs and snow-pummeled passes. The electric sedan, already on its last legs, slid, groaned, and twitched beneath them. They crawled along at slow speeds, not daring to make a mistake.</p><p><p>Visibility dropped to five meters at best through the thick smoke-like fog.</p><p><p>They passed two jackknifed trucks, one flipped hatchback, and a cluster of abandoned snowed in SUVs. Somewhere near the summit, the snowfall turned to sleet, the sleet to pellets, and then to an eerie stillness as fog swallowed the mountain.</p><p><p>Neither spoke for most of the drive out of tension and survival instinct.</p><p><p>By the time they rolled into Kelowna, it was well after dark. The streets glistened under ice, and the city felt more like an outpost clinging to the edge of some frozen frontier.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2036%20-%20British%20Columbia/u8296664269_heavy_foggy_snow_storm_blizzard_icy_frozen_mounta_6c29be3f-4220-48ee-b6f3-adb0c8b58dc5_1.png" alt="u8296664269_heavy_foggy_snow_storm_blizzard_icy_frozen_mounta_6c29be3f-4220-48ee-b6f3-adb0c8b58dc5_1.png" class="content-image"><p><The Coquihalla Highway><p><strong>21:11 - Kelowna, Downtown Edge</strong><p>“We should park somewhere random, and walk around to look for a shitty motel that doesn’t have any cameras.” said Steven.</p><p><p>So, Dmitry turned into a dead-end side street, flanked by dumpsters and shuttered repair shops. They parked, wiped down every surface they’d touched with a bleach soaked ragged, and locked the doors manually.</p><p><p>The street was dead silent.</p><p><p>“If someone finds it, we’re just two tired drunks who take the bus.” Dmitry muttered.</p><p><p>They kept their duffel bag of weapons and essentials, leaving behind the leftover food and frivolous electronics.</p><p><p>They walked six blocks through ice-slicked sidewalks and empty strip mall lots until they reached it.</p><p><p><strong>21:28 - Sleepy Pines Motor Inn</strong><p>A flickering neon sign. Half the letters dead.</p><p><p>The building looked more like a converted sanitarium than a hotel.</p><p><p>A woman with matted bleach hair stood barefoot outside one room, chain-smoking in a silk robe. Another man, shirtless despite the cold, was arguing with a broken vending machine.</p><p><p>Steven spoke up as they walked by it “Lex, look at this place - a Crackwhores paradise.”</p><p><p>They entered, the front desk smelled like cat piss… but they took cash.</p><p><p>And more importantly ; no cameras.</p><p><p>They handed over enough bills for one night, no questions asked. The clerk didn’t even blink at the stack of 1$ American bills.</p><p><p>Inside, their room was musty, stained, and reeked faintly of old sex.</p><p><p>Steven collapsed onto the bed, still in his coat, pulling the pistol from his waistband and setting it on the nightstand.</p><p><p>“Man… Coquihalla’s a hell of a bitch.”</p><p><p>“That road’s got more ghosts than we do.”</p><p><p>Dmitry didn’t respond. He was already checking the seams of the motel room windows, checking the bathroom, verifying the vents didn’t have any hidden cameras or microphones, double-locking the front door, and moving a chair in front of it.</p><p><p>Only after the room felt secure did he sit on a sofa and whisper:</p><p><p>“This was supposed to be easy…”</p><p><p>“Just one checkpoint.”</p><p><p>Steven gave a low chuckle, dry as sand.</p><p><p>“Yeah. And next one’s just the Canadian prairies.”</p><p><p>“Flat, cold, empty… and full’a demons.”</p><p><p>Outside, the wind howled across the parking lot, and snow began to fall again.</p><p><p>The motel room settled into silence.</p><p><p>Steven pulled the scratchy blanket over his chest. Dmitry’s sofa creaked as he finally leaned back, pistol within reach. They both exhaled slowly, trying to let the day drain from their bones.</p><p><p>The light was turned off.</p><p><p>Stillness.</p><p><p>Darkness.</p><p><p>Almost peaceful.</p><p><p><strong>Click.</strong><p>The light in the bathroom flicked on.</p><p><p>Both men blinked; groggy, half-asleep; their eyes drifting to the thin line of light seeping out from under the closed bathroom door.</p><p><p>They stared at the gap under the door.</p><p><p>A shadow passed behind the door.</p><p><p>And then it stopped.</p><p><p>The shade of two feet.</p><p><p>Just barely visible from the bottom slit of the door, stationary, silent.</p><p><p>Neither man breathed.</p><p><p>And then, without ceremony, the Pig spoke.</p><p><p>The voice oozed with disdain, but also… something else.</p><p><p>A hint of injured pride.</p><p><p>As if <em>it</em>… the <em>Pig</em>… wanted <em>them</em> to feel like the real monsters.</p><p><p>“You would save the lives of thirty mortals… people who will all be dead within eighty years…”</p><p><p>“And in return… you would <em>wipe out</em> an entire species… the <strong>Oc’Xari</strong>, spread across thousands of galaxies, in numbers your little brain couldn’t even count.”</p><p><p>“And <em>you</em>… <em>you dare to judge me</em>… for tormenting a handful of souls?”</p><p><p>“I who aim to correct the infection… to purge the spyware… to repair what was broken when your ancestors tampered with my blueprint?”
”I built a Pyramid of flesh upon Nhexus to destabilize the sun, I saved them from their eternal sorrow.”
”And you are selfish pests, easily controlled by threats towards your friends and family.”</p><p><p>Steven didn’t even sit up. Just exhaled flatly:</p><p><p>“Well… goodnight to you too.”</p><p><p>The voice hissed like a dying vent pipe.</p><p><p>“Six days.”</p><p><p>Click.</p><p><p>The bathroom light went out.</p><p><p>And the shadow vanished.</p><p><p>The motel was dark again.</p><p><p>Steven turned his face into the pillow.</p><p><p>Dmitry rubbed his eyes, then stared up at the ceiling.</p><p><p>“What’s it take to get a good night’s sleep around here…”</p><p><p>Neither one slept for a while.</p><p><p><h3><strong>II. Revelstoke</strong></h3><p>By some miracle, they actually did fall asleep.</p><p><p>The alarm clock in the motel room started blaring at 10:15 AM probably set by some methed-out guest from a previous night.</p><p><p>At least they got to sleep in a bit.</p><p><p>They stirred awake, groggy and sore, limbs aching from motel mattresses older than both of them combined. Breakfast came out of their duffel bags ; crushed granola bars, a half-eaten bag of trail mix, an energy drink warm from being in someone’s coat pocket too long.</p><p><p>They brushed their teeth using dollar-store brushes, washed their armpits and ass cracks in the sink… a “Whore’s Bath” they called it, with the awkwardness of two grown men trying to remain human while living like ghosts.</p><p><p>Then, back out to the cold.</p><p><p>Their stolen beater car was still parked half a dozen blocks away, right where they’d left it. Untouched. Not even ticketed.</p><p><p>Steven remarked: “She waited for me.”</p><p><p>They climbed in. The engine coughed awake.</p><p><p>“Next stop…” Dmitry said, hot wiring the car to get the heater going.</p><p><p>“Calgary?” Steven added, with a big, sarcastic question mark.</p><p><p>“Yeah… Dallas and Haoyu will be waiting at the airport like last time.” Dmitry muttered, remembering how Kelowna turned from a three-hour drive into seven thanks to the Coquihalla’s frozen wrath.</p><p><p>And so, they hit the road.</p><p><p>It wasn’t <em>as</em> bad as the previous night’s ice trek, but it still sucked.</p><p><p>As they rolled past the ragged skeletons of pine trees, and through winding mountain stretches, they entered a run-down town that looked like Detroit’s cracked-out cousin.</p><p><p>The sign read:</p><p><p><strong>VERNON</strong><p>Steven’s brow furrowed. He leaned out the window slightly.</p><p><p>“What a shithole.” he commented flatly.</p><p><p>They didn’t stop.</p><p><p>Another hour or so passed.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2036%20-%20British%20Columbia/vernon.png" alt="vernon.png" class="content-image"><p>As they drove alongside the mirror-calm water of Mara Lake near Sicamous, Steven locked his eyes on the iced-over expanse.</p><p><p>“Looks like Florida.” he said, squinting at the frozen lake surface. “If Florida had snow instead of sand, pines instead of palms, and a few thousand mountains shoved up its ass.”</p><p><p>The road twisted again, higher now. The snow on the roadside deepened. Trees began closing in.</p><p><p>After some time, Revelstoke came into view ; if you could <em>call</em> it a city. More like just a gas station and a couple buildings awkwardly pretending to be civilization, surrounded by snow-drowned mountains.</p><p><p>They pulled in for fuel.</p><p><p>The air smelled of diesel, pine, and wet gravel.</p><p><p>As Dmitry started pumping gas, a law enforcement emergency vehicle rolled up. A single officer got out, wearing a high-vis jacket and looking cold, tired, and indifferent to the universe.</p><p><p>Steven started panicking, hand on the glock in his waistband.</p><p><p>Dmitry’s stomach plummeted as the officer approached.</p><p><p>“Hey ; just a heads-up,” the officer said casually.</p><p><p>“There was an avalanche just east of here, and there’s a heavy snowstorm warning between us and Calgary. The roads are closed. If I were you? I’d hunker down here for the night.”</p><p><p>Without waiting for a response, the officer turned and strolled into the gas station mini-mart.</p><p><p>Dmitry let out a long, tension-fueled breath.</p><p><p>“Whew… that was a close one.”</p><p><p>Steven ungripped his glock, relaxed, and leaned back in the passenger seat, looking at the snow-clouds rolling in overhead.</p><p><p>“Guess we’re staying in Gas Station Toilet Buttfuck Mountain Town tonight,” he said with that same deadpan Florida charm.</p><p><p>A short drive later, they found the nearest motel.</p><p><p>It looked newer than the last one, but the price was almost double. Still rundown, still half-buried in snow, but at least the neon vacancy sign was on.</p><p><p>Dmitry planned; “Let’s go in, if we can get a room, lets come back out and move the car.”</p><p><p>Inside the lobby, the air smelled pleasant of pine and Christmas scents. The staff behind the counter seemed immediately annoyed when Dmitry tried to pay with American cash.</p><p><p>“We don’t accept cash,” the clerk said with suspicion, glancing at their unshaven faces, ratty coats, and generally apocalyptic look.</p><p><p>But the pleading from Dmitry, and Steven’s annoyed:</p><p><p>“You want us to die in a snowstorm?”</p><p><p>…somehow swayed the man’s logic.</p><p><p>With great reluctance, the clerk counted the stack of dollar bills and slid them a keycard.</p><p><p>As soon as the motel key was in their hands, Dmitry told Steven “I’m going to move the car.” as he bolted out the door, leaving Steven behind in the lobby.</p><p><p>He ran out to where his stolen beater was parked, engine still warm under the snowfall. First thing he did was wipe down the steering wheel, gearshift, door handles, dash; everything; with a bleach-soaked rag he pulled from a ziplock bag.</p><p><p>The scent was harsh. Acrid. Chemical paranoia in cloth form.</p><p><p>He peeled out the glove compartment contents, tore out any receipts, wrappers, gum, anything that might even <em>hint</em> at who they were. Tossed it all into a grocery bag, stuffed it in a public trash bin down the street. Then he backed the car out, turned down a residential back road, and parked it five blocks away beneath a snow-heavy cedar tree.</p><p><p>Dmitry wiped the door handles again for good measure, shut it softly, and pulled up his hoodie.</p><p><p>He was about halfway back when he looked down.</p><p><p>Footprints.</p><p><p>His boots were punching clear, deep marks into the fresh powder.</p><p><p>He froze - Paranoia overwhelming…</p><p><p>Then sighed.</p><p><p>“Snowstorm’s coming anyway,” he muttered to himself.</p><p><p>“They’ll be buried within an hour.”</p><p><p>He kept jogging, breath puffing white in the mountain air. By the time he made it back to the motel, snow had already started drifting sideways. The storm was arriving right on cue.</p><p><p>Inside, a warm, log cabin, ski resort type room, with a rocking chair, wooden beds, and a few animal taxidermy heads hung on the walls. Steven was already relaxed, lying sideways on the double bed, TV flickering blue light across his face as some ancient sitcom played.</p><p><p>“They got a deer head, bear head, fox head… no pig head.” Steven observed.</p><p><p>“The pig should come and protest. Put up a pig head or die in eternal hellfire.” Dmitry joked as he kicked off his boots, locked the door, and got to work.</p><p><p>He dragged the wooden chair from the corner across the carpet and jammed it under the doorknob, just like before. Then made his rounds ; opening drawers, sliding back the curtains an inch, checking vents, peeking into the motel closet, opening the bathroom, peeking behind the shower curtain. No shadows. No whispers.</p><p><p>He let out a slow, heavy sigh and finally settled near the end of the bed, still tense.</p><p><p>“You think Piggie’s gonna be in the bathroom this time,” he asked, “or hiding in the closet to give his nightly sermon?”</p><p><p>Steven smirked without looking up from the TV.</p><p><p>“I dunno, man. I hope he’s out there preaching to the snowstorm. Maybe it’ll make a deal with it to fuck off.”</p><p><p>Dmitry chuckled and leaned his head back against the wall.</p><p><p>The wind outside began to howl like wolves.</p><p><p>But for now, at least, the room was quiet.</p><p><p>Five days.</p><p><p>That’s what they thought, murmured, and etched silently in their minds before the motel room dimmed into sleep.</p><p><p>The night wasn’t quiet, but it was strangely peaceful. The blizzard howled like a pack of arctic beasts outside their thin motel walls, winds screaming, snow pelting sideways like a million shattered needles. But the room was warm, smelled like pine, the mattress soft.</p><p><p>They slept like babies.</p><p><p>Dreamless, merciful sleep.</p><p><p>8:30 AM</p><p><p>A mechanical buzzing from the nightstand clock. Annoying and shrill.</p><p><p>Steven groaned.</p><p><p>Dmitry sat up slowly, swung his legs off the side of the bed, and blinked the blur from his vision.</p><p><p>He walked to the window and drew the curtain back just a crack.</p><p><p>“Well, shit,” he muttered.</p><p><p>A solid sheet of white covered the town. Cars, sidewalks, lamp posts; everything had been buried beneath what looked like ten feet of fresh powder. And it was still falling. The wind still shrieking.</p><p><p>Behind him, Steven was rubbing his face.</p><p><p>“How’s it look, Captain?” he asked, voice still lazy with sleep.</p><p><p>Dmitry didn’t turn away from the glass.</p><p><p>“There’s not a single car moving through the snow. Not one. Roads are dead.”</p><p><p>Steven reached lazily for the TV remote, flicked it on; static.</p><p><p>He flipped through the channels. Still static.</p><p><p>“Guess the storm took out cable.”</p><p><p>He pulled out his phone. “No bars.”</p><p><p>They both sighed in sync.</p><p><p>They chewed through dry granola bars, cracked open a couple bottles of water, and took turns showering for real this time; long, hot, quiet showers, washing away the stale motel stink of yesterday’s survival. The storm boomed like war drums outside, but inside, they were trying to pretend; just for a moment; that this was normal.</p><p><p>By 10:55, they packed up their gear and went down to check out.</p><p><p>The lobby was crowded.</p><p><p>Couples in parkas. Families. Older folks still in pajamas. Travelers with sleds. A woman clutching a suitcase and her teacup poodle. All gathered around a uniformed man in a blue parka; his badge visible.</p><p><p>It was the same officer from the gas station the day before.</p><p><p>His voice was calm, professional, trying to carry authority and friendliness all at once.</p><p><p>“Last night,” he said, “an avalanche took out a few of our local cell towers. Luckily, nobody was hurt. But I do need to give you an update about the weather.”</p><p><p>Dmitry and Steven exchanged a glance.</p><p><p>“This storm…” the officer continued, “is not your average snow dump. They’re calling it a superstorm. One of the worst to ever hit the interior. It’s expected to rage for the next four to five days. That’s the forecast, and believe me; if it clears up sooner, we’ll let you know.”</p><p><p>There were groans.</p><p><p>Some gasps.</p><p><p>One guy at the back dropped his suitcase and muttered, “Jesus Christ.”</p><p><p>The officer raised a hand.</p><p><p>“I know it’s not what you want to hear. But we do have some good news. The province of British Columbia has declared this an emergency weather lockdown, and the government will fully compensate your motel stay until the storm ends.”</p><p><p>Half the room cheered. The other half muttered curses.</p><p><p>“So,” he smiled, trying to lighten the mood, “think of this as an unexpected free vacation. Revelstoke’s a beautiful place this time of year. We’ve got some great little craft breweries, world-class snowboarding slopes, a couple steakhouses, a hotspring thermal bathhouse, cozy cabins, and a museum for anyone who likes a bit of local history. Try to make the most of it, folks.”</p><p><p>He smiled again and turned to speak with the desk staff.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2036%20-%20British%20Columbia/u8296664269_police_officer_in_hotel_lobby_speaking_with_crowd_a8e28498-3c70-4687-906e-9deb37ab1ce2_3.png" alt="u8296664269_police_officer_in_hotel_lobby_speaking_with_crowd_a8e28498-3c70-4687-906e-9deb37ab1ce2_3.png" class="content-image"><p>Dmitry and Steven stood near the edge of the crowd, still as statues.</p><p><p>“Five days…” Dmitry whispered.</p><p><p>“We’ve got five days left to make it over the mountains to Calgary…”</p><p><p>“...And another 500 clicks through prairie roads to Swift Current.”</p><p><p>“And we’re stuck in a frozen tourist trap.”</p><p><p>“All because some cosmic entity is pissed about intergalactic spyware.”</p><p><p>Steven blinked, expression blank.</p><p><p>“We’re so fucked,” he said.</p><p><p>Dmitry exhaled.</p><p><p>“Wanna… go back to the room and… I don’t know…”</p><p><p>“Yeah,” Steven nodded.</p><p><p>“Let’s just go… figure out how doomed we are.”</p><p><p>They turned, pushed back through the crowd, and climbed the stairs.</p><p><p>The snowstorm roared outside like it wanted to eat the world.</p><p>
