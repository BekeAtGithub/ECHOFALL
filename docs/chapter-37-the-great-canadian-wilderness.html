                <h1>Chapter 37 - The Great Canadian Wilderness</h1><h3><strong>I. Free Vacation</strong></h3><p>They sat in the motel room, silent, almost statues.</p><p><p>The heater hummed in the background, muffled by the <em>thump-thump</em> of windblown snow against the windows. Steven fiddled with the remote again; still static. Dmitry’s fingers drummed against the window frame, stared outside as if he expected the storm to magically clear up.</p><p><p>“Still white,” he muttered.</p><p><p>“Still nothing.”</p><p><p>No cars. No movement. Just snow swallowing a town.</p><p><p>But then… his eyes caught a sliver of something.</p><p><p>A sign poking out from a drift; barely readable, crusted in frost.</p><p><p>DOWNTOWN 50m AHEAD</p><p><p>Through the haze, he could just make out the rooftops of what passed for Revelstoke’s downtown. A small cluster of buildings. Maybe twenty. One with a glowing red “Open” sign flickering.</p><p><p>“You wanna check out the town?” Dmitry asked.</p><p><p>Steven groaned.</p><p><p>“We’re gonna rot with Haoyu in eternal torture anyway.”</p><p><p>Dmitry gave him a sideways look.</p><p><p>“Well, I won’t. Just you guys will.”</p><p><p>Steven chuckled dryly.</p><p><p>“Oh yeah… that was in the fine print of Option 1.”</p><p><p>“What; you didn’t want to make your own deal to at least save me?”</p><p><p>Dmitry smirked.</p><p><p>“Nyet. You deserve it.”</p><p><p>Steven cackled, half-hearted and cold.</p><p><p>They got dressed in what barely passed for winter gear; cheap, dollar-store beanies, faux synthetic-wool gloves, plastic-lined jackets with insulation thinner than paper towel. Steven’s boots still had a tag from ValueZone.</p><p><p>They trudged out of the motel and into the howling white, pushing into the wind like old men on a death march.</p><p><p>Fifty meters felt like five hundred.</p><p><p>But finally; downtown Revelstoke.</p><p><p>A dozen touristy shops, all with cozy hand-carved signage. One craft brewery with lights on inside, and a sign outside offering “Blizzard Specials.” A few kids sliding across frozen sidewalks, throwing snowballs, laughing. The only vehicles in sight were half-buried.</p><p><p>Then they saw it; a snowboarding and outdoor gear store, bigger than the rest. Like a quaint Bass Pro Shop squeezed into a mountain town with a population of three thousand.</p><p><p>Outside the front doors - lined up were two expensive, high tech snowmobiles.</p><p><p>“These are pretty heavy duty, you could probably drive this through a mud bog in Louisiana.” explained Steven as he sat on one, admiring the quality of the build.</p><p><p>“Let’s see what else they have.” Dmity said, as they ducked inside.</p><p><p>Warmth hit them like a wave. Fireplace, cabin lighting. Bright. Cozy.</p><p><p>Rows of gear lined the walls; jackets, boots, helmets, snowboards, tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, skis, goggles, gloves, socks, water filters, solar panels. A survivalist’s paradise.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2037%20-%20The%20Great%20Canadian%20Wilderness/adventuregear.png" alt="adventuregear.png" class="content-image"><p>Steven walked over to one of the first jackets on display. A sleek, high visibility orange, tech-insulated parka, wrapped in what looked like a hybrid of thermal alloy and carbon mesh. Sleek shoulder plating. Inner heating coils.</p><p><p>“Damn…” he whispered.</p><p><p>He flipped the tag.</p><p><p>“Eight thousand dollars.”</p><p><p>Dmitry glanced over and shot him a glare.</p><p><p>“Blyat. That’s worth more than the car we borrowed from Langley.”</p><p><p>They turned. And there it was; a wall of snowshoes, heat-treated boots, thermal gloves, and snow pants lined with silver heat film.</p><p><p>A young sales associate, probably no older than twenty, with a lanyard and eager smile, bounced over.</p><p><p>“Hey guys! You looking to do some real snow hiking? These just came in; top of the line, field-rated in Alberta’s wilds!”</p><p><p>Dmitry nodded coolly.</p><p><p>“Yeah, we want to try on the whole outfit. Snowshoes, boots, thermal underwear, gloves, mask; everything.”</p><p><p>“And get sizes for my friend too.”</p><p><p>The kid’s eyes lit up.</p><p><p>“Of course! Right this way; man, you guys are gonna love this stuff. Just got some new kits in from Calgary too, top shelf.”</p><p><p>As the kid went to pull gear from the racks, Steven leaned close and whispered:</p><p><p>“Bro… we have less than 500 bucks in cash.”</p><p><p>Dmitry didn’t look at him.</p><p><p>“No,” he said. “We have credit cards. We can afford it. No problem.”</p><p><p>Steven blinked.</p><p><p>His face said it all.</p><p><p>“No we d—” - <strong>shhhh</strong></p><p><p>And then; he let out an understanding “<em>ohhhh”</em>.</p><p><p>Ten minutes later, they were fully outfitted. Matching suits of tech-winter armor; insulated, reinforced, sleek. New gloves. Tinted visors. High-tension snowshoes. Beneath it all, high-grade thermal underlayers that regulated body temperature through microcurrent pulses.</p><p><p>Steven struggled to carry a pile of emergency gear; rations, fire kits, a water purification wand, solar heater, couple handheld radios, and a folding survival tent.</p><p><p>They dropped it all at the checkout counter.</p><p><p>The kid grinned. “Let me just start ringing you up-”</p><p><p>He starts scanning a few items, the dollar numbers going up quickly into the tens of thousands,</p><p><p>Dmitry unzipped the duffel bag.</p><p><p>Click.</p><p><p>The barrel of the Mac-10 came out first, followed by Dmitry’s hand, then the fully-loaded mag sliding in with a slap.</p><p><p>He leveled it square at the kid’s face.</p><p><p>“We’re taking all of it,” he said, voice cold as steel.</p><p><p>The kid’s pupils shrunk.</p><p><p>His breath caught in his throat.</p><p><p>He nodded slowly.</p><p><p>“Y–yes… y-you’re taking… all of it.”
”Give us the keys to the snowmobiles, or you die.” Commanded Dmitry.</p><p><p>The young associate shakily handed the keys over.</p><p><p>They grabbed the bags, slinging everything they could carry; Steven muttering obscenities, staggering under the load.</p><p><p>They bolted out the door, into the snow.</p><p><p>Behind them, the kid scrambled for the phone; only to remember.</p><p><p>No signal.</p><p><p>No towers.</p><p><p>No roads.</p><p><p>The only law in Revelstoke now was weather.</p><p><p>And it wasn’t on anybody’s side.</p><p><p><h3><strong>II. The Heist</strong></h3><p>The air outside slapped them in the face.</p><p><p>Snow came sideways, wind curling like claws. But they didn’t stop.</p><p><p>Just outside the shop, Dmitry passed a key and a radio to Steven, they got onto the snow mobiles, put them into gear.</p><p><p>“Go!” he barked.</p><p><p>They drove. Though the snow deep, powdered, heavy, the snowmobiles crunched through it like a warm knife through butter.</p><p><p>The engine and exhausts huffed steam into the air.</p><p><p>“HOLY SHIT.” Steven yelled through the radio with adrenaline fueling his body “I DIDN’T KNOW WE WERE GONNA DO THAT?!”</p><p><p>Dmitry replied.</p><p><p>“Either we wait here for you to rot in eternal hell, or we take the chance.”</p><p><p>Steven groaned, breath short.</p><p><p>“And the car back in Langley? That wasn’t stolen, that was borrowed...”</p><p><p>He glanced behind them at the store.</p><p><p>“Let me guess. This gear? Borrowed too?”</p><p><p>Dmitry grinned through his chapped lips.</p><p><p>“Of course. We’ll return it.”</p><p><p>“Oh yeah. Yeah, right. Mail it back. Hand-deliver it in twenty years after our space war ends.”</p><p><p>Behind them, muffled by wind, they heard the sales associate’s voice ; faint, <em>desperate</em>:</p><p><p>“Help! Thieves! Robbers!”</p><p><p>But the storm swallowed the sounds whole.</p><p><p>His pleas for aid were no more than whispers against the howling gusts.</p><p><p>Just like their tracks, which already vanished beneath fresh powder.</p><p><p>Dmitry glanced behind once, saw only white, and nodded forward.</p><p><p>“This way.”</p><p><p>Ahead of them loomed the edge of town ; where streets gave way to thin trees, then denser woods.</p><p><p>They veered off the road, driving beside in the woods beside it, weaving through frost-covered pines to break up their trail incase anyone was watching, or following… which in this storm… nobody was after them.</p><p><p>“Hey Dmitry, we’ve been driving in the woods for an hour, we should go back on the road, my snowmobile keeps getting snagged in big pockets of snow, bushes and branches”</p><p><p>-With that, they went back onto the main highway. Which wasn’t a road at all, complete snow. But at least there weren’t any trees or shrub.</p><p><p><h3><strong>III. Vast Mountain Roads</strong></h3><p>They’d make good distance, after a couple hours they’d driven 90 kilometers, slowly through the merciless deep snow. The cold, punishing wind didn't matter. Their jackets were built like small-scale spacesuits: auto-heated cores, built-in A/C channels, some kind of internal sweat-repelling smart fabric that somehow kept their bodies warm and dry.</p><p><p>They pulled over for a rest. Steven took his foot off the pedal, put it in on the road, and it started sinking deep…</p><p><p>“Uhh… Yeah I’m gonna put my snow shoes on, I have no idea how deep this snow is, I might drown in it.”</p><p><p>Dmitry and Steven both fastened their snow shoes, stretched their legs.</p><p><p>Dmity breathing deep, a rare smile peeking through cracked lips. Checked the tag on the snow mobile - $20,000.</p><p><p>“Shit… These snowmobiles are nice. And 8000 bucks is a lot for a jacket. But I think it’s actually worth it.”</p><p><p>Steven, nodded and adjusted the collar of his own.</p><p><p>“Yeah, these jackets are amazing. What was the brand on them again?”</p><p><p>Dmitry turned slightly to read the big bold lettered logo on the front of his jacket.</p><p><p>“Archon.”</p><p><p>Steven tilted his head.</p><p><p>“Huh. Sounds like the name of a planet.”</p><p><p>They both laughed. Yeah right- who would name a planet <em>that.</em></p><p><p>“How much did everything cost?” - “Easily over 40k for everything... with the snow mobiles- probably 80k before taxes.”</p><p><p>Their breath fogged in front of them as they sat back down, checking fuel.</p><p><p>“How much fuel do you have Steven?”</p><p><p>“Uhhh, yeah, it’s like close to empty - about eighth of a tank left.”</p><p><p>“Me too…” Dmitry said stressed out.</p><p><p>“Well, we gotta try and make it to the next town at least…” said Steven.</p><p><p>Without another word, they continued their drive down the highway.</p><p><p>After a while, the landscape opened up around them; vast glaciers like frozen oceans, canyons rimmed with dagger-toothed pine trees, cliffs that looked like cracked stone teeth in the jaw of a sleeping god.</p><p><p>They passed a frozen waterfall, its glassy strands caught mid-fall, gleaming like a crystal chandelier from another dimension.</p><p><p>Beside them: a vast glacial lake, crystalized, encased in a sheet of ice several feet thick. A ripple moved under the surface, or maybe it was just their imaginations.</p><p><p>The sky faded to indigo. Then black.</p><p><p>Their helmet visors, which had seemed like overpriced gimmicks back in the shop, kicked in automatically; night vision activating with a subtle green hue across their display. A small HUD in the lower corner showed temperature, windspeed, direction.</p><p><p>“Did your vision just light up?” Steven asked.</p><p><p>“Yeah these helmets are sweet - I would buy one if I was rich.” Replied Dmitry.</p><p><p>“Well, we are rich today.” Steven replied.</p><p><p>The wind, the weight, the heavy deep snow; it wore on them like gravity.</p><p><p>Some time passed, and Stevens snowmobile came to a halt.</p><p><p>“What’s wrong?” - Dmitry asked through the radio, a few meters ahead, slowing down.</p><p><p>Steven panicking - trying to turn it back on, the electronics just displaying a red fuel icon - “Shit, I’m out of fuel.”</p><p><p>Dmitry pulled around, beside him - “Get on, let’s keep going.”</p><p><p>“$20,000 left in the dust… was fun.” Steven said upset, trying to climb onto the back of Dmitry’s snow mobile… “You got too much gear, I can’t fit on. We got all my gear too, what are we bringing?”</p><p><p>Dmitry stressing out - looking at the bags of survival gear… “Just put on one backpack, and let’s… let’s tie the bags to the back with a rope, and drag it behind us, we can go slow, keep an eye on it incase something important falls out.”</p><p><p>After Steven tied them to the back, he hopped on the back seat, and they continued their trek.</p><p><p>Another maybe 20 minutes, and Dmitry’s snowmobile also died, ran out of fuel.</p><p><p>They both get off, put on their snow shoes, with great difficulty as the wind raged on, blowing snow so powerful they could barely see their noses.</p><p><p>The night was pitch dark, even their night vision helmets didn’t do much good with all the snow.</p><p><p>“Let’s tie the bags around our waists, I guess we walk and we can drag the gear behind us.” said Steven.</p><p><p>Dmitry panicking and fearfully said; “The Great Canadian Wilderness.”</p><p><p>They trudged along the thick snow, for a few meters - “I can’t see you, where are you?” Steven asked through the radio…</p><p><p>“Shit, we should tie a rope between each other so we don’t lose each other, I can’t see anything.”</p><p><p>They tied a rope amongst themselves and their gear they dragged behind them. And they slowly fought their way through the insane dense snowfall of the superstorm.</p><p><p>At some point, they lost the road as they pushed deeper into the woods, off the roadside path, through a thicket of frozen brush.</p><p><p>“I think we need to setup camp, I have no idea where we are right now, I don’t know when we left the road.” Said Dmitry.</p><p><p>So- with that, they rummaged through their gear.</p><p><p>Tent. Stakes. Zip. Anchor lines.</p><p><p>Thermal sleeping bags.</p><p><p>No fire. No light. Just warmth and invisibility.</p><p><p>Neither of them spoke much. The exhaustion was in their bones now.</p><p><p>As they each slid into their respective bags inside the tent, wind attacked like a hurricane, damn near blowing them away.</p><p><p>But the gear was expensive, quality, and held strong by some miracle.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2037%20-%20The%20Great%20Canadian%20Wilderness/37.jpg" alt="37.jpg" class="content-image">
