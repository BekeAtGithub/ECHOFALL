                <h1>Chapter 10 - Revelation</h1><h3>I. The Revelation</h3><p>The rover, powered by AI, continued on autopilot as the crew was still in awe and shock.</p><p><p>The rover collected tissue residue embedded in the fossil layers right at its landing area.</p><p><p>Partial RNA chains. Mitochondrial fragments.</p><p><p>The AI reconstructed what it could.</p><p><p>As the crew was still sitting, stunned, as if what they saw wasn’t horrific enough, they get a big alert on the rovers live feed, as the data is cross compared with our data sets from biology databases back on earth, the alert reads:</p><p><p><strong>Direct Genetic Match:</strong><p><strong>99.999984% genomic overlap with LUCA-origin mitochondrial patterns</strong><p><strong>52% coding similarity to early Earth eukaryotes</strong><p><strong>Shared amino acid redundancies in regulatory genes</strong><p><strong>Species is a relative match to Earth</strong><p>The monsters of Nhexus weren’t alien to Earth.</p><p><p>They were distant cousins.</p><p><p>They were us ; if Earth had gone horribly wrong.</p><p><p>The commander gets a phone call from the Chief of Military in India… he says</p><p><p>“Are you looking at this sir?”</p><p><p>Commander responds … “yeah”</p><p><p>CoM of India asks; “What do we do?”</p><p><p>Commander;</p><p><p>“Stop the rover, we’ve seen enough for today, contact all the other countries who have visuals on this project and ensure none of this gets leaked to the public”</p><p><p>A chatter broke out amongst the crew with topics of</p><p><p>“How are these things related to us?”</p><p><p>“It must be an error”</p><p><p>“Is all life in the universe related?”</p><p><p>“The life isn’t <em>actually</em> related, it’s possible other life in the universe simply exists from the same genetics”</p><p><p>“Is that what life evolves into?”</p><p><p>“Did life hitchhike from there to here? Is that how Earth started?”</p><p><p>“Should we begin a project to launch a bigger rover to collect samples to bring back to Earth for research?”</p><p><p>The questions and chatter went on for hours.</p><p><p><h3>II. Panic and Secrecy</h3><p>The initial Echofall findings were received and quarantined by the United Nations Deep Space Data Authority (UN-DSDA).</p><p><p>A Level-7 containment protocol was activated:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Data routed through quantum firewalls</li>
<li>AI systems scrubbed and reset</li>
<li>Top-level personnel briefed in classified domes</li>
</ul><p>Public disclosure was not considered. The fear wasn’t aliens ; it was the implications:</p><p><p>“If these things are related to us, then either we’re not special ; or we’re next.”</p><p><p>But secrets don’t keep when twelve international research hubs are fed the same live stream and raw data.</p><p><p><h3>III. The Leak</h3><p>The first breach came from a rogue postdoc in Madrid who smuggled a DNA cross-similarity chart onto a private meshnet. The information uploaded into a thread on 4chan.</p><p><p>The post was dismissed as deepfake science fiction.</p><p><p>Then reposted. Then reconstructed.</p><p><p>Then replicated.</p><p><p>Independent labs in Mumbai, Tehran, Osaka, Nairobi, and Rio all confirmed it within three weeks.</p><p><p><ul>
<li>The genome match wasn’t an anomaly.</li>
<li>The fossil structure was real.</li>
<li>The probability of a hoax was essentially zero.</li>
</ul><p>Hobbyists with expensive telescopes started looking for the planet, like trying to find a needle in a haystack.</p><p><p>That’s when governments panicked harder ; and the public started to believe.</p><p><p><h3>IV. Humanity’s Reaction</h3><p>The truth didn’t arrive with fanfare. It leaked.</p><p><p>And when it leaked, it <em>poured</em>. It was like the Epstein Files all over again.</p><p><p>The revelation; that Earth shared genetic ancestry with the horrors of Nhexus; landed like a psychic meteor. And like any great cosmic trauma, humanity processed it in stages.</p><p><p>The primary control center of UN-DSDA in America restricted access from all other countries involved in the project and only allowed control of the rover from their singular team to keep public leaks and data breaches to a minimum.</p><p><p>This of course caused mass tension and conflict between nations, civil wars broke out, politicians fired, media uproar, urban riots, some countries publicly barking threats about nuclear war.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2010%20-%20Revelation/u8296664269_A_powerful_Renaissance-style_painting_depicting_t_857bbe96-b1c1-4952-a425-07a7c79bc7b1_2.png" alt="u8296664269_A_powerful_Renaissance-style_painting_depicting_t_857bbe96-b1c1-4952-a425-07a7c79bc7b1_2.png" class="content-image"><p><An urban riot in Sofia, Bulgaria><p><h3><strong>DENIAL</strong></h3><p>It was the first shield.</p><p><p>People dismissed the findings as:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>A deepfake campaign</li>
<li>A rogue AI storytelling experiment</li>
<li>An alternate reality video game with clever viral promotion</li>
</ul><p>Pundits accused quantum research labs of stirring panic. Church leaders dismissed it as heretical biotech propaganda. Even mainstream scientists demanded multiple replication trials.</p><p><p>“DNA is weird. We’re all 60% banana. This is another lab error.”</p><p><p>But then came the corroborations.</p><p><p>The fossil overlays.</p><p><p>The amino pattern confirmations.</p><p><p>Denial didn’t last long.</p><p><p><h3><strong>FEAR</strong></h3><p>The second wave was worse.</p><p><p>Forums exploded:</p><p><p><ul>
<li><em>“What if we’re becoming them?”</em></li>
<li><em>“What if our evolution isn’t over; just halfway there?”</em></li>
<li><em>“Was that pyramid their city? Or their grave?”</em></li>
<li><em>“What if Earth is Nhexus in disguise?”</em></li>
</ul><p>Suicide hotlines surged.</p><p><p>Bioethics panels were formed overnight. Schools paused genetics curriculums. Parents pulled their children from science academies.</p><p><p>A meme trended worldwide:</p><p><p>“We are the pre-slop planet.”</p><p><p><h3><strong>FASCINATION</strong></h3><p>Then came the obsession.</p><p><p>Anthropologists wrote papers titled:</p><p><p><ul>
<li><em>“Sentience Without Progress: A Study of Slop Society Politics and Culture”</em></li>
<li><em>“Slop Loops in Evolution”</em></li>
<li><em>“The Ossari Obelisks as Burial or Biology?”</em></li>
</ul><p><h3><strong>RELIGIOUS UPHEAVAL</strong></h3><p>The sacred was not spared.</p><p><p>Dozens of new cults and philosophical sects emerged almost overnight:</p><p><p><ul>
<li><strong>The Slop Mirror</strong> ; preached that Earth’s beauty was earned at the cost of a twin’s torment.</li>
<li><strong>Children of the Lost Kin</strong> ; demanded an expedition to recover and <em>redeem</em> Nhexus through AI resurrection.</li>
<li><strong>The Silent Flesh</strong> ; believed purpose was a lie, and that true life was persistence without meaning.</li>
</ul><p>Others twisted the findings:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Some called for purity laws against genetic modification, fearing another divergence.</li>
<li>One megachurch claimed Earth must now “beg forgiveness from the Great Flesh God.”</li>
</ul><p><h3><strong>Christianity</strong></h3><p>The Vatican issued three contradictory statements in the first 72 hours. The Fourth Council of Rome was convened within a week.</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Catholic leaders debated whether the creatures of Nhexus had souls, and if <em>original sin</em> could apply to non-human organisms.</li>
<li>Evangelicals split ; half viewed the planet as a "second Eden defiled," while others declared it Hell’s fossil record.</li>
<li>A new Protestant movement, <em>The Second Flesh Covenant</em>, declared Jesus would return <em>not to Earth</em>, but to redeem the forgotten world first.</li>
</ul><p><h3><strong>Islam</strong></h3><p>Prominent imams and Islamic scholars held emergency fatwa councils across Mecca, Cairo, and Jakarta.</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Many reaffirmed Allah’s dominion over all creation, declaring Nhexus a divine warning of what happens when creation forgets its Creator.</li>
<li>A rising minority sect, <em>The Ummah of Reflection</em>, suggested that Earth had been <em>chosen twice</em> ; once as a home, once as a mirror.</li>
<li>A few fundamentalist groups declared the rover’s mission haram and demanded Earth “close its eyes to the sins of fallen worlds.”</li>
</ul><p><h3><strong>Judaism</strong></h3><p>Rabbis worldwide gathered in urgent yeshiva congresses.</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Kabbalistic scholars speculated that Nhexus was the Qliphoth; a realm of spiritual husks.</li>
<li>Some ultra-Orthodox communities banned media footage of the creatures, claiming it “polluted the nefesh.”</li>
<li>Reform and Reconstructionist groups embraced the story as a tragic reflection on Tikkun Olam; the duty to heal even what lies beyond Earth.</li>
</ul><p><h3><strong>Hinduism</strong></h3><p>The news sparked debate among swamis, gurus, and Sanskrit philosophers.</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Some sects saw Nhexus as proof of Samsara; a life trapped in a karmic loop of suffering with no release.</li>
<li>Others interpreted the planet as a lower loka, akin to Naraka; a dimension of torment between incarnations.</li>
<li>One influential guru proclaimed: <em>“Even the ugliest creation is still Brahman in form. It suffers because we do.”</em></li>
</ul><p><h3><strong>Buddhism</strong></h3><p>Monastic orders held silent meditation vigils that lasted weeks.</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Many considered Nhexus a planetary embodiment of Dukkha, the truth of suffering.</li>
<li>Tibetan lamas debated if the planet’s fate was caused by collective karma.</li>
<li>A Zen roshi in Kyoto simply whispered, “They clung too hard to form.”</li>
</ul><p><h3><strong>Sikhism</strong></h3><p>The Akal Takht issued a solemn reflection:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>“If the Creator forged life in many worlds, then our duty is the same: to serve, protect, and mourn it.”</li>
<li>Sikh scholars debated whether seva (service) could apply to a world that was already dead.</li>
<li>A youth movement arose calling for interplanetary aid and remembrance through daily Ardas (prayer).</li>
</ul><p>Countless other religions were scrambling, questioning, and justifying.</p><p><p><h3><strong>World War 5</strong></h3><p>The world spiraled into chaos- for a reason unrelated to the previous 4 wars… this time over an alien planet.</p><p><p>After the United States isolated the Echofall project, countries left in the dark in disagreement such as Russia, Brazil, India, China all launched attacks onto American soil, leading to great battles in trying to retake control of the project.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2010%20-%20Revelation/480275715_122229585044031351_1342528694955967010_n.jpg" alt="480275715_122229585044031351_1342528694955967010_n.jpg" class="content-image"><p>The brutal wars of carnage grinded hundreds of thousands of infantry soldiers into ground meat twisted with metal.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2010%20-%20Revelation/dd1d41d2-5071-48df-9988-89c1bc6e05f1.png" alt="477467728_122225686574031351_2817685855151205236_n.jpg" class="content-image"><p><img src="images/Chapter%2010%20-%20Revelation/477581717_122225686694031351_447112889045708431_n.jpg" alt="477581717_122225686694031351_447112889045708431_n.jpg" class="content-image"><p><h3><strong>THE ARTISTIC EXPLOSION</strong></h3><p>And then came the most unexpected wave.</p><p><p>Art.</p><p><p>Pain became paint. Horror became opera. The grotesque was reinterpreted as <em>sacred longing</em>.</p><p><p>A new genre emerged: Slop Aesthetic</p><p><p><ul>
<li><strong>Sculptures</strong> formed of recycled meat-based polymers</li>
<li><strong>Fashion</strong> that emulated broken symmetry and reverse anatomy</li>
<li><strong>Poetry</strong> written in intentionally malformed grammar, meant to simulate degenerative cognition</li>
<li><strong>Horror operas</strong> where audiences wore flesh masks and moved in unison through maze-theaters as if part of a digestive system</li>
</ul><p>One viral music video featured a dancer in a translucent skin suit performing alongside 3D renderings of parasite larva folding themselves into prayer.</p><p><p>Not everyone understood it.</p><p><p>But everyone felt it.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2010%20-%20Revelation/nhexusart.png" alt="nhexusart.png" class="content-image"><p><h3>V. A New Perspective</h3><p>Nhexus wasn’t just a dead world.</p><p><p>It was a mirror, held shakily in Earth’s hand.</p><p><p>Humanity had long feared being alone.</p><p><p>Now it feared being related.</p><p><p>The revelation reframed evolution:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Earth had not <em>triumphed</em>. It had won a jackpot like a gambler playing slots at a casino.</li>
<li>Life was not sacred. It was chaotic.</li>
<li>Intelligence was not destiny. It was chance.</li>
</ul><p>Scientists began to whisper among themselves:</p><p><p>“Maybe this solves the Fermi Paradox. Maybe all the aliens just evolve into slop.”</p><p><p>Classrooms rewrote biology textbooks.</p><p><p>Universities offered courses in comparative evolution.</p><p><p>Museums debated whether to exhibit Nhexus fossils; or seal them in lead.</p><p><p>And everywhere, in the background, the same question pulsed:</p><p><p>What if it happens to us?</p><p><p>How do we know if it will happen?
Will there be obvious signs?</p><p>
