                <h1>Chapter 27 - Countryside Chaos</h1>The rural Sylver were not like their urban kin.</p><p><p>They didn’t attack. But their eyes were wide. Fearful. They hid behind tree stumps, disappeared into hollow dens beneath root systems, or clung to the sides of their cotton-beast homes, whispering into their coats to trigger camouflage. The beasts responded, sprouting shaggy layers of fur ; an attempt to blend into the fields.</p><p><p>It didn’t work.</p><p><p>But the effort was telling.</p><p><p>“We’re not welcome,” Dmitry muttered.</p><p><p>“Dunno,” Steven said, squinting. “I think we just spooked the hillbillies.”</p><p><p>He waved toward one of the beasts.</p><p><p>“Y’all ever see a poodle turn into a shed before? That one just became a damn blanket barn.”</p><p><p><h3><strong>VIII. The Road Signs</strong></h3><p>They followed the nearest path down into the plain ; past anxious stares, rustling thickets, and twitching camouflage. The road forked several times, and at each intersection, a signpost stood tall ; made of bark and twine, with symbols woven directly into the knots.</p><p><p>Faint memory sparked in both men.</p><p><p>“Lex. These are letters.”</p><p><p>“Thread alphabet,” Dmitry confirmed, squinting. “But... fuzzy. I’ve forgotten half.”</p><p><p>“Same. It’s like it’s in the back of my head somewhere, just gotta dig it up.”</p><p><p>They stopped at a wide patch of dirt.</p><p><p>Dmitry grabbed a bush stick laying in the grass next to it. Steven knelt beside him.</p><p><p>Together, they re-drew the thread alphabet ; carving each symbol into the road with crude lines and muttered guesses.</p><p><p>Memory came in bursts.</p><p><p>A letter here. A pattern there.</p><p><p>It was like trying to reassemble a broken stained-glass window.</p><p><p>But after an hour of kneeling in the dust, joking about pubic hairs in the shower, wiping sweat from their brows, and arguing over symbol positions, they were almost there.</p><p><p>“This one’s the ‘S’ sound,” Steven said, pointing to a crooked hook.</p><p><p>“And this one’s… maybe a root glyph for ‘home.’”</p><p><p>“No, that one was the macaroni symbol. I remember ‘cause it looked like my Aunt Carla’s elbow noodle casserole.”</p><p><p>Dmitry chuckled ; the first time since the police raid.</p><p><p>Eventually, after squinting at their hand-scratched alphabet and matching the curves, hooks, and threads of each glyph to the ones woven into the signposts, Steven and Dmitry stood confidently beneath the tall wooden marker at the crossroads.</p><p><p>It pointed in five different directions ; each path winding off into fields, forest, or low hills.</p><p><p>They began to sound out the woven script aloud:</p><p><p>“Maa...lith-ren,” Steven said, frowning. “That’s what this one says.”</p><p><p>“That one says ‘Thesselvine,’” Dmitry muttered, translating the arch-loop script with his finger.</p><p><p>Another sign:</p><p><p>“Kaelum,” he said. “Sounds... elevated.”</p><p><p>“Ooo, this one’s got a squiggle like that shower hair symbol ; says Drolshan,” Steven added, nodding. “Probably haunted… which means it probably has answers!”</p><p><p>Dmitry half-ignoring it, proceeding to read the final sign:</p><p><p>“Nystral,” Dmitry read, blinking. “That sounds… familiar. But I don’t know why.”</p><p><p>They stood in silence for a moment.</p><p><p>Five signs. Five roads. Five cities they’d never heard of.</p><p><p>“So… which one takes us back to Haoyu in the ribcage jail cell?” Steven asked.</p><p><p>“We never knew what the first place was even called,” Dmitry admitted. “Was it Maalithren? Drolshan? Was that even the city’s name?”</p><p><p>“I don’t even know which direction we came from…”</p><p><p>Steven scratched his head and looked down all five roads.</p><p><p>“We can read the words now… but we still got no clue where we’re goin’.”</p><p><p>Dmitry grunted.</p><p><p>“Knowledge, but no experience.”</p><p><p>“Preach it, Kremlin Gandalf.”</p><p><p>They sighed. The silence returned.</p><p><p>Steven scratched his chin thoughtfully, eyes flitting between the five road signs as if any of them might blink first.</p><p><p>“Alright, Lex. Here’s what we do.”</p><p><p>Dmitry gave him a sideways glance, already dreading the pitch.</p><p><p>“You pick a road. I pick a road. We play rock-paper-scissors.”</p><p><p>Dmitry blinked. “Are you serious.”</p><p><p>“Dead serious,” Steven grinned. “If the Oc’Xari brought us here for a reason ; y’know, through all that star-map dream-ladder bullshit ; then maybe luck is the point.”</p><p><p>“Maybe they’re watchin’ right now, cheerin’ for the universe to throw a bone.”</p><p><p>Dmitry stared flatly.</p><p><p>“And your plan is to determine a multi-dimensional cosmic objective… with rock-paper-scissors.”</p><p><p>Steven nodded like a prophet delivering scripture.</p><p><p>“Exactly. You ever heard of divine dice-rolls? That’s what this is. Galactic chance. If we’re meant to go somewhere ; the road we choose by luck’ll be the one they wanted.”</p><p><p>Dmitry sighed.</p><p><p>“I spent thirty years building communication systems to interface with advanced alien cognition networks…”</p><p><p>“And now I’m gambling quantum coordinates with a Florida man over hand puppets.”</p><p><p>Steven raised his fists.</p><p><p>“Best of three?”</p><p><p>Dmitry groaned, shook his head “Just once” and held up his hand.</p><p><p>They shook.</p><p><p>“Rock, paper, scissors; shoot!”</p><p><p>Steven: scissors</p><p><p>Dmitry: rock</p><p><p>Steven’s smile faded.</p><p><p>“Damn.”</p><p><p>Dmitry looked at the sign he had picked ; Thesselvine.</p><p><p>“Guess that’s our road.”</p><p><p>Steven shrugged, stepping toward the path with hands behind his head.</p><p><p>“Welp. If it kills us, it’s technically your fault.”</p><p><p>Dmity snapped back- “<em>tsskk</em> It’s the Oc’Xari’s fault.”</p><p><p>“Thesselvine has a ring to it tho, I’m gonna call it ‘The Vine’ like it’s a vine back in the gator infested swamps of the Bayou,” Steven cheered.</p><p><p>Dmitry gave a small shake of his head, but his eyes had a flicker of amusement.</p><p><p>“So now we let chance guide our interstellar diplomacy?”</p><p><p>“Hell yeah,” Steven nodded. “Let fate steer. And if it goes bad, I’ll tell the next dream alien it was your fault.”</p><p><p>They set off down the path of the unknown ; a random roll of fate echoing through a dreamscape stitched by biology, memory, and mystery.</p><p>
