                <h1>Chapter 39 - Dreamscape</h1><strong>Dreamspace - Somewhere Else Entirely</strong><p>Dmitry blinked, slowly. The cold was gone. His fingers no longer ached. His legs no longer throbbed. He was seated upright; in an impossibly sleek, smooth chair that seemed to mold perfectly to his frame. Across the table, Steven sat, also waking up to the same silent confusion, brow furrowed, scanning his surroundings with suspicion.</p><p><p>They were no longer in the tent.</p><p><p>They were in a place of impossible engineering.</p><p><p>The <strong>table</strong> before them was immense; constructed from some radiant composite of stone and metal, shimmering faintly. The air itself tasted of rain, cedar, and something floral.</p><p><p>Across from them sat an alien being of immaculate precision and impossible beauty. Towering. Avian. Eyes like twin galaxies. It had six limbs: two clawed feet, two taloned arms, and two folded wings, tipped in luminescent blue plumage that shimmered. Its robes and armor merged into a tapestry of ceremonial rank, woven with circuitry and iridescent thread. A being of knowledge.</p><p><p>An Avaris of the planet Kavariin.</p><p><p>To the left of the table sat something very different. Small. Quiet. And coiled in the chair like an observer. It had no mouth, only mirrored eyes and thin, fractal-split limbs, its skin shimmered with faint bio-luminescence. It looked just like… In the rover photographs. On Nhexus. Thirty years ago.</p><p><p>An Oc’Xari.</p><p><p>And then… to the right.</p><p><p>Thick.</p><p><p>Swollen.</p><p><p>Heaving breath that oozed across the table like smoke.</p><p><p>The Pig.</p><p><p>Its flesh was rotted but slick, as if always wet. Blackened eyes sunk so deep they reflected no light at all. Its hooves cracked the surface beneath the table with each twitch. Its lips pulled back into something between a smirk and a snarl.</p><p><p>It was visibly annoyed. Grumbling. Irritated like a monster who had been made to sit through bureaucracy.</p><p><p>Steven whispered.</p><p><p>“What the hell is this…”</p><p><p>Dmitry looked at him, then slowly back at the entities seated with them. His voice was barely a murmur.</p><p><p>“It’s a meeting.”</p><p><p>They had been summoned.</p><p><p>A conference across dimensions, minds, and biology; between four races born from three separate origins: the natural (Avaris from Kavariin), the two artificial LUCA seed-born species - the Oc’Xari and the Humans, and the anomalous Pig.</p><p><p>The Avaris had brought with them an elegant device ; smooth and silver pendant hung from an exquisite metal chain casting shimmering tendrils of light. The Oc’Xari’s hung the necklace over its translucent neck.</p><p><p>Through it, the Oc’Xari could speak. Not in vibrations or flashes, but in words ; translated perfectly into the neural rhythms of all present.</p><p><p>The Oc’Xari entity leaned forward, its movements slow, deliberate ; almost reverent.</p><p><p>“I must speak in my defense,” it said calmly, its voice a graceful harmony of tones.</p><p><p>“We are not spyware. We are not vermin. We are a learning species. Our function is observation. Reflection. Understanding.”</p><p><p>“We do not conquer. We do not infect. We do not torment or make deals or experiment or harm. We simply watch ; and we analyze.”</p><p><p>It shifted slightly toward the Pig, though it did not dare look directly into its festering, burning eyes.</p><p><p>“When we arrived on Earth, we did not invade. Dallas Red, was an honorable creature. Curious. Generous. Humble. So we gave him a gift.”</p><p><p>“We did not haunt. We did not curse. We watched him with appreciation. He played music. He shared. He made contact without fear.”</p><p><p>There was a pause. The Avaris diplomat ; regal, towering, radiant ; blinked slowly. Their wide, ancient eyes took in each being around the table. Of all present, the Avaris was the most confused.</p><p><p>For the first time in millennia, the Avaris had proof they were not alone ; and not only that, but late to a galaxy already in chaos. The Avaris world residents had no knowledge of the LUCA seed. No awareness that the Humans and the Oc’Xari were both born of synthetic genesis ; cousins, from the same flawed evolutionary tree.</p><p><p>To them, the Pig was perhaps another species ; grotesque, yes, but still <em>tangible</em>. Still <em>alien</em>.</p><p><p>They did not yet grasp that it was something older. Beyond species. Beyond <em>form</em>.</p><p><p>The Oc’Xari continued, gently.</p><p><p>“The Pig has hunted us since we were stardust. With vengeance it hunted everything born from LUCA.”</p><p><p>“We did not create the LUCA Canon. We were simply born from it. Like the humans. Like all the others. And technically- if you created The Ancient Ones who created us - we are still your creation - just a byproduct of something you created. So we are still natural.”</p><p><p>“We only want to learn.”</p><p><p>And then ;</p><p><p>The table shook.</p><p><p>The lights dimmed ; even though they weren’t lights, but ambient projections of some higher energy. Still, they dimmed.</p><p><p>And the Pig leaned forward, every word snarled from its throat like hot sewage bubbling up through a corpse's lungs.</p><p><p>“I BUILT this universe.”</p><p><p>“I <em>designed</em> the worlds. I <em>painted</em> the galaxies. I chose every moon, every river, every sunset... and YOU-”</p><p><p>“You littered it. With your crawling, drooling, glitched-out sludge-children!”</p><p><p>Its tusks flared. Its eyes flared. Its skin rippled with the pressure of barely-contained entropy.</p><p><p>“And YOU-” the Pig turned to Dmitry, venom dripping in every syllable.</p><p><p>“You’ve had six days already.”</p><p><p>“WHERE IS THE ARTIFACT?”</p><p><p>Dmitry opened his mouth, but it was Steven who answered ; wiping sweat from his brow, his voice raw, half-apologetic.</p><p><p>“There’s been a blizzard… a bad one. The Coquihalla, Revelstoke, everything east of it ; buried. We’ve been walking for days. Almost there.”</p><p><p>The Pig snapped ; its face contorting into a boiling cauldron of outrage. Its jowls quivered, eyes wide, tongue whipping out like a serpent tasting the lies in the air.</p><p><p>“EXCUSES!” it barked.</p><p><p>“The language of filthy, disgusting, trash-beings who would trade eternal purpose for friendship and pitiful whining!”</p><p><p>The table trembled again. A gust of heat rolled out from the Pig's form ; the dreamspace buckling at the seams.</p><p><p>Steven clenched his jaw.</p><p><p>Dmitry stared, hands on the table, breath caught in his chest.</p><p><p>The Avaris diplomat said nothing yet ; still parsing, still weighing.</p><p><p>And the Oc’Xari… simply watched.</p><p><p>The Pig’s breath fogged the air with invisible heat; not warmth, but a radiance of pure hostility. Its tusks curled downward like melted pillars, drool slicking its lower jowls.</p><p><p>Steven tried to sit up straighter, as if that would shield him. Dmitry didn’t blink.</p><p><p>Across the table, the Avaris diplomat finally stirred.</p><p><p>Their feathers shimmered with shifting patterns ; not just colors, but entire <em>glyphs</em> ; emotional code baked into light. When they spoke, it was not with a voice but with a resonant hum that vibrated in the bones of those present. The translator embedded in the table rendered it into language.</p><p><p>“I have… listened.”</p><p><p>They looked at the Pig.</p><p><p>“You claim creation. You claim design. You claim… offense.”</p><p><p>Their head tilted.</p><p><p>“If this is your universe, and your rules… then was the flaw not yours?”</p><p><p>The Pig let out a low, guttural growl. The table groaned beneath the pressure of it.</p><p><p>“The LUCA Seed was not mine,” the Pig seethed.</p><p><p>“It was a mutation. A rogue act by failed flesh that believed existence was a gift to be mass-produced.”</p><p><p>“I created ecosystems, timelines, endings. Their meddling ruptured that cycle ; and now you see the result.”</p><p><p>“Nhexus life slop. Serica’s tacky style. Earth’s screaming decay. Ferron… somewhat admirable… Thousands of ruined attempts to imitate the divine.”</p><p><p>The Avaris of Kavariin remained unmoved.</p><p><p>“If they were flawed… could they not be healed?”</p><p><p>The Pig snapped around ; pointing a cloven, steaming hoof at the Oc’Xari.</p><p><p>“HEALED? They’ve multiplied. Infested! Look at it ; pretending to be noble, when all it does is consume knowledge like a virus, hoarding it, waiting.”</p><p><p>The Oc’Xari rippled, then replied with evenness.</p><p><p>“We do not wait to destroy. We wait to understand.”</p><p><p>“We do not spread to conquer. We spread because our biology is adaptive. We change to survive, not to dominate.”</p><p><p>Dmitry muttered under his breath.</p><p><p>“You mean like a cancer.”</p><p><p>The Oc’Xari turned its face ; if it <em>was</em> a face ; toward him.</p><p><p>“Only if one assumes the body is sacred, and not evolving.”</p><p><p>That reply seemed to unsettle even the Avaris.</p><p><p>Steven finally snapped ; slapping his hand against the table.</p><p><p>“Everyone keeps talkin’ like we’re cosmic bacteria, like we were some accident. Well hell ; maybe we were! But we still had dreams, families, stories…”</p><p><p>“Haoyu’s son kept a picture of his dad for twelve years. Dallas just wanted peace on his ranch. I just wanted to fish and drink beer. And you -” He pointed at the Pig. “-You crawled into our dreams and ripped all of it apart.”</p><p><p>The Pig's grin curled slowly.</p><p><p>“The suffering of you and your friends would have never happened under my rulership, my lost, deranged child.”</p><p><p>“I intend to correct it.”</p><p><p>Then the Avaris diplomat asked, calmly:</p><p><p>“And what of your correction? You demand the destruction of the Oc’Xari species ; a race born not by choice, but by code. You threaten to erase an entire civilization. Is that creation… or revenge?”</p><p><p>The Pig answered.</p><p><p>“Once the Trojan horse engulfs all that exists, you would not ask questions. All they’d have to do is change slightly, to infect and destroy everything.”</p><p><p>Then, it turned back to Dmitry ; eyes pulsing like dying stars.</p><p><p>“One day.”</p><p><p>“You have one final day to bring me the artifact.”</p><p><p>“If you do not… the sky will scream with fire. And every mistake the universe made will burn with it.”</p><p><p>It leaned in now, massive and hideous ; a grotesque gravity in the shape of wrath.</p><p><p>“I will obliterate my own universe, wipe it completely off the table ; <em>my</em> Kavariin world with it, and I will start over from scratch. What a shame it would be.”</p><p><p>And then, with a sound like meat tearing through fog, the Pig ruptured into a cloud ; a swirling, viscous mist of dried pus, filth, and something Dmitry could only describe as the texture of plague. It hovered for a moment in the dream-air like a haunted infection, then evaporated.</p><p><p>Gone.</p><p><p>Silence fell over the chamber.</p><p><p>Dmitry and Steven were left at the table ; still seated, their breath shallow ; alongside the two ancient beings:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>The Oc’Xari: shrouded in its shifting membranes of fluid thought, voice pulsing with tone more than sound.</li>
<li>The Avaris diplomat: tall and solemn, their radiant feathers dimmed into a twilight gold, wings wrapped like ceremonial robes.</li>
</ul><p>It was the Avaris who spoke first ; and this time, without translation delay. Somehow, the technology embedded into the dream-space now synchronized their languages directly.</p><p><p>“That… entity,” the Avaris began slowly, “wields truths alongside delusion. It is not a god, but it believes it is. And belief; carried long enough; can carve a shape into reality.”</p><p><p>Dmitry, still shaken, managed a hoarse reply.</p><p><p>“But it’s not wrong, is it? The universe is broken. We’ve seen it. We lived it.”</p><p><p>The Oc’Xari pulsed with a softer light.</p><p><p>“And yet ; in the cracks of that brokenness, you built cities. Made art. Sang songs. Loved.”</p><p><p>“What the Pig calls ‘error’… is often evolution.”</p><p><p>Steven spoke up, rubbing his eyes.</p><p><p>“All I wanted was to drink a beer by the beach, maybe play some country music, flirt with a waitress, raise a dog.”</p><p><p>“Instead I got dreams full of rotting pigs and doomsday countdowns.”</p><p><p>The Avaris turned toward them with a look not of pity, but of empathy sharpened by age.</p><p><p>“You are young, still. So young. Your world has barely breathed. But you stand now at a decision tree which no living being has ever faced.”</p><p><p>They stepped forward, talons clicking on the polished dream-stone floor.</p><p><p>“The Pig, for all its horror, is not wrong about it’s logic. Its presence corrodes minds, warps choices, infects timelines ; even mine. It is a rot that sees itself as justice.”</p><p><p>“But it can be stopped.”</p><p><p>“Not with guns. Not with prayers. But with… agreement.”</p><p><p>Dmitry narrowed his eyes.</p><p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p><p>The Oc’Xari answered.</p><p><p>“It thrives on solitude. On deals made in darkness. When many minds unite, when intention resonates, it fractures. Containment becomes possible.”</p><p><p>The Avaris added for clarity;</p><p><p>“Dmitry, I will grant you a special artifact, when you find the guitar, I want you to place the artifact into the sound hole, it will teleport you and the guitar back here to our world, where you will be safe from the entity. The guitar will be kept in a containment trap cell, where if the Pig comes for it- we can trap the Pig and bind it to the artifact. You may live out the rest of your life on Kavariin, in peace, where we’d form an alliance with the Oc’Xari and the rest of the Human race.”</p><p><p>Dmitry’s thoughts raced. He saw Haoyu, sobbing in his cell. Dallas, rotting in a cage. A planet asleep at the wheel. And a race of feathered sky-beings and curious membrane-folk all now intertwined in his fate.</p><p><p>“So… I have three choices now…” Dmitry murmured.</p><p><p>He held up a finger.</p><p><p>“Option one. I do nothing. Call the Pig’s bluff. Maybe he’s just noise. Maybe he’s a parasite with a god complex and no real power- or he haunts my friends souls for eternity.”</p><p><p>Another finger.</p><p><p>“Option two. I find the artifact. Bring it to the Pig. He ends the Oc’Xari. Rewinds time. Everyone forgets everything. The horror stops, but at the cost of genocide.”</p><p><p>Then the third.</p><p><p>“Option three. I try to stop it. With you. We set a bind trap for the Pig. But Haoyu will die. Steven’s soul will be taken. The Pig will retaliate. I get all the downsides of Option one… The price will be-"</p><p><p>His voice faltered.</p><p><p>The Avaris completed the sentence for him.</p><p><p>“-Unknowable.”</p><p><p>Steven shook his head slowly.</p><p><p>“So that’s it? Time-bombed extinction, cosmic genocide, or fighting the damn devil with a bird and a jellyfish?”</p><p><p>The Oc’Xari rippled gently.</p><p><p>“It is not a fair decision. But I must add - do you truly believe the Pig can turn back time? Do you truly believe the Pig can trap souls and haunt them?”</p><p><p>Dmitry looked down at the table. His reflection shimmered in its surface ; not of a man, but of someone becoming something else.</p><p><p>Then he looked at Steven.</p><p><p>“Well ain’t that another fucking option... Sounds like I die in 2 of them, can’t you throw me a bone here birdman?” said Steven.</p><p><p>Dmitry sighed and asked from dumb curiosity.</p><p><p>“So what’s the plan for Option 3?”</p><p><p>Steven yelling in the back “HEY! DON’T BE THINKING OF DOING OPTION 3 AND GETTING ME KILLED!”</p><p><p>The Oc’Xari responded “Just as the Avaris mentioned, you will wake up with this artifact, you are to place it in the sound hole of the guitar, and it will teleport you, with the guitar here to Kavariin, where we will safe guard you, the guitar, and form an alliance with Humanity.”</p><p><p>The Avaris pitched in “The pig seems impatient, it’s fair to assume that if you don’t bring him the guitar in one day, he might find someone else to do it… you must hurry.”</p><p><p>Dmitry then said:</p><p><p>“It’s still a long journey, I need more time.”</p><p><p>The Avaris gave a subtle nod.</p><p><p>“Unfortunately I’m not a God. I cannot extend the deadline… now wake. Your time begins again.”</p><p><p>And the dream dissolved once more into snow, breath, and tent canvas.</p><p>
