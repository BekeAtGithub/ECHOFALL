                <h1>Chapter 22 - Ferron</h1><h3>I. Ferron</h3><p>Haoyu opened his eyes to heat.</p><p><p>Not stifling ; more like the inside of a smithy, rich with fire and metal and breath. The air tasted like iron and smoke.</p><p><p>He stood on a jagged ridge overlooking an immense city built into a slag valley, rivers of molten ore winding through obsidian rock beds. Thunder rolled in the distance ; not storm, but forge thunder ; some massive engine beating like a heart beneath the world.</p><p><p>He looked down.</p><p><p>His boots were strange ; segmented like armor. His clothes? Not his clothes. His sleeves were stitched from iron-thread fabric, glowing subtly with the same copper hue as the strings on the alien guitar.</p><p><p>A voice called out:</p><p><p>“Commander.”</p><p><p>Haoyu turned.</p><p><p>Dallas stood nearby on the ridge, similarly dressed ; but his outfit was a strange fusion of his cowboy aesthetic and something far older. He wore a long duster made of some heat-tempered cloth, a wide-brimmed metal-lined hat, and chainmail laced leather gloves.</p><p><p>“I guess we’re back in it,” Dallas said.</p><p><p>They turned together, looking out across Ferron.</p><p><p>Below them, figures moved ; tall, horned silhouettes ; the Rhonza. Whole processions of them, walking through the streets of the valley, hauling glowing tools, chanting in harmony. Massive towers belched smoke and light as they hammered metals into shapes.</p><p><p>Haoyu swallowed, his voice caught between awe and fear.</p><p><p>“Where the hell are we now?”</p><p><p>Dallas squinted out at the forge towers in the distance.</p><p><p>“I have no idea… is this… ancient Earth?”</p><p><p><A riverside oil refinery and chemical processing center><p><img src="images/Chapter%2022%20-%20Ferron/28.jpg" alt="28.jpg" class="content-image"><p>Before Haoyu could respond ; before he could even wonder whether this was some ancient vision of Earth or something stranger ; a deep thudding came from behind them.</p><p><p>He turned fast.</p><p><p>From the twisted ironwood forest at their backs, five figures emerged ; Rhonza.</p><p><p>Each stood at least seven feet tall, walking upright on hoofed feet, their postures imposing and almost regal. Their horns curved wide like ceremonial blades, reminiscent of Texas longhorns but patterned with glowing engravings ; some chiseled, others etched like molten ink. Their skin bore faint ash-blue and brown hues, muscles coiled like they were carved from volcanic stone.</p><p><p>They didn’t resemble cattle; far from it.</p><p><p>They looked human enough to be unsettling. Their faces were long and sharp, with eyes like cooled metal. Their expressions? Stern. Exhausted. Dangerous.</p><p><p>Four of them carried enormous bundles of blackened, resinous logs ; tied in symmetrical stacks with bands of woven copper thread. The fifth ; clearly the leader ; walked slightly ahead with a colossal battle axe slung across his back, its haft studded with iron runes that faintly shimmered in the forge haze.</p><p><p>As they passed, their hooves crunched against the slag gravel.</p><p><p>The lead Rhonza paused beside Dallas and Haoyu, snorting through broad nostrils like he’d just caught the scent of garbage.</p><p><p>He looked them both up and down.</p><p><p>Then shouted ; voice deep and sharp ; down the valley toward the settlement below:</p><p><p>“Who let the rats into our logging camps again?!”</p><p><p>The other four barked with mocking, dismissive laughter ; and continued stomping their way down the stone path, their wood bundles balanced like toothpicks in their massive arms.</p><p><p>Dallas watched them go, adjusting his hat slowly.</p><p><p>“Well,” he muttered, “guess we’re vermin now.”</p><p><p>Haoyu didn’t speak. He just stared at them in awe, heart still hammering.</p><p><p>Down the valley, the city in view ;</p><p><p>Stone homes with thatched or copper-threaded roofs dotted the hillside, but they were intersected by an impossible blend of sacred engineering ; massive bellows the size of town halls, pistons thrumming like church organs, great gears rotating skyward as if they were attempting to wind the sky itself. Pillars of black smoke drifted into the crimson clouds above.</p><p><p>Every building seemed to be part machine.</p><p><p>Some bled molten light from their seams. Others pulsed with rhythmic vibrations ; like they were alive.</p><p><p>Haoyu exhaled.</p><p><p>“This place shouldn’t exist.”</p><p><p>Dallas nodded, slowly.</p><p><p>“Feels like a factory had a kid with a cathedral and raised it in a blacksmith’s playground.”</p><p><p>Haoyu turned to him, voice quiet.</p><p><p>“They called us rats.”</p><p><p>Dallas shrugged.</p><p><p>“Better than ‘intruders.’ At least rats get left alone sometimes.”</p><p><p>They stood there a moment longer ; staring down at the city of flame and memory, the chanting of hammers echoing up toward them from the basin.</p><p><p>Then Haoyu said, more to himself than to anyone else:</p><p><p>“I guess… Let’s check it out.”</p><p><p><h3>II. City of Ironheart</h3><p>They descended the ridge in silence.</p><p><p>The road down to the valley was steep ; carved not by intention but by years of heavy carts and iron-shod hooves wearing grooves into the earth. The deeper they walked into the basin, the louder the sound of labor became. Clanging hammers, groaning pulleys, hissing steam vents ; all chanted together in an industrial hymn that seemed older than language.</p><p><p>The city was alive with labour and machinery, sprawling with contradiction. The buildings were made from sticks, mud, hay, and stone, but reinforced with perfect copper latticework, gears embedded into walls like mechanical ivy. Some homes had chimneys, and others with just ceiling vents leaking blue smoke that smelled faintly like incense and battery acid.</p><p><p>Rhonza workers rushed past them in the narrow cobbled street, hauling massive wheelbarrows filled with glowing rods, twisted steel beams, and molten-brass cores.</p><p><p>A massive horned figure bumped into Haoyu, nearly knocking him over. He caught his footing just in time, but they kept coming. Another rushed past Dallas with a hiss of steam from a shoulder-mounted pack. No apologies. No curiosity.</p><p><p>Just work.</p><p><p>They were in the way, Dallas and Haoyu had to walk right at the side edge of the path just to barely get out of the way of all the foot traffic.</p><p><p>they followed the streets deeper into the city's central square, with market stalls, bustling tradesman and customers, massive crowds doing business, the noise crescendoed into a dense fog of movement and metallic breath ; and that’s when they saw it.</p><p><p>“Wait…” Haoyu slowed to a stop.</p><p><p>Dallas did too.</p><p><p>“Are you kidding me?”</p><p><p>There it was.</p><p><p>Right in the center of the market square, wedged between a forge-temple and a spiraled gear tower:</p><p><p>The Chuckwagon Café.</p><p><p>Same faded wooden sign.</p><p><p>Same red-painted doors.</p><p><p>Same damn hanging “OPEN” sign.</p><p><p>It looked absurdly normal against the alien cityscape. It didn’t belong ; and yet… it fit too well, like a glitch in the dream’s design. Exactly like it had always appeared. Dream. Memory. Real life.</p><p><p>Haoyu turned to Dallas.</p><p><p>Dallas just rubbed his chin.</p><p><p>“Here we go again…”</p><p><p>They stepped inside.</p><p><p>The interior was different this time.</p><p><p>Gone was the modest country charm of the real-world version. Instead ; this was a grander echo. The ceilings were twice as high, vaulted and adorned with rotating iron fans suspended on rails. The walls were built from copper-lined timber. The bar was back, stretching long across the left wall ; real mahogany-looking wood, embedded with glowing script.</p><p><p>Dallas sighed in a gentle relief that the bar was back.</p><p><p>And behind the bar…</p><p><p>She stood.</p><p><p>Not a beast.</p><p><p>Not a shadow.</p><p><p>But a female Rhonza ; smaller than the rest they’d seen, but stunning in an uncanny way.</p><p><p>Her face was almost human, save for the elongated cheekbones and shimmering skin ; like brushed titanium beneath a layer of glass. Her horns stood straight up, capped in bronze rings. A chain of jewelry danced across her brow. Her tail, coiled with golden bands, swayed as she dried a glass ; but her eyes narrowed the second she saw them.</p><p><p>“Ugh,” she muttered.</p><p><p>“No rats. Get out.”</p><p><p>She gestured at a sign above the door, showing a rough sketch of a small, hunched rodent like critter with twitchy limbs and a giant X through it.</p><p><p>Dallas raised both palms, trying to calm the mood.</p><p><p>“Hey now, hold on. We don’t mean trouble. We just got here, and we’re trying to figure out where here is. Where are we, exactly?”</p><p><p>She rolled her eyes so hard it looked like they might steam.</p><p><p>“Ha. What a trick question, why don’t you bother someone else.”</p><p><p>Then she paused ; glass halfway through a polish ; squinting at them both more intently.</p><p><p>“Wait…”</p><p><p>“You’re serious.”</p><p><p>Haoyu and Dallas both just… nodded.</p><p><p>She exhaled in disbelief, then smirked ; that same sharp, cutting sarcasm as a tired city bartender who’s dealt with too many drunks.</p><p><p>“Well, since you two were clearly born under a rusted rock… this is Ironheart. One of the oldest, biggest cities on Ferron.”</p><p><p>Haoyu’s face went pale.</p><p><p>“Fe… Ferron?”</p><p><p>She tilted her head.</p><p><p>“Yeah, I don’t know what you rats call our world. But we ; civilized folk ; call it Ferron. Now...”</p><p><p>She slammed the glass down hard on the counter, loud enough to make Dallas jump.</p><p><p>“GET OUT.”</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2022%20-%20Ferron/u8296664269_httpss.mj.runSqs-e8iZT7Q_httpss.mj.run41vR_ds3CIA_e82b76bd-a634-45be-8c04-e70ff352e7fb_2.png" alt="u8296664269_httpss.mj.runSqs-e8iZT7Q_httpss.mj.run41vR_ds3CIA_e82b76bd-a634-45be-8c04-e70ff352e7fb_2.png" class="content-image"><p><Female Rhonza bartender by the name of Jarkzi><p>They exited quickly, backs straight, not daring to look at the patrons inside ; Rhonza merchants, traveling smiths, a few armored juggernauts drinking something thick and brown from metal mugs.</p><p><p>The door slammed shut behind them with a hiss of hydraulics.</p><p><p>They stood outside in the haze of Ironheart’s main market, the smells of steam, oil, and soot flooding their senses.</p><p><p>Dallas wiped his brow.</p><p><p>“Well,” he said. “That went better than expected.”</p><p><p>Haoyu just stared at the café door, still processing.</p><p><p>“This place isn’t just a dream anymore. It’s… a real world. A real culture. Cities. Citizens. Schedules.”</p><p><p>“And somehow they still hate us,” Dallas added.</p><p><p>“Ferron,” Haoyu repeated quietly. “It’s real.”</p><p><p>They both turned and looked around ; the towering smokestacks, the humming pipeline aqueducts, the forge towers in the distance.</p><p><p>“And we’re not just dreaming this time,” Haoyu said. “it’s like we’re being shown different parts of some grander story’.”</p><p><p>Dallas reached down and touched the cobblestone road beneath them. It was warm. Solid. Rough.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2022%20-%20Ferron/u8296664269_massive_steampunk_mechanical_village_mut_huts_str_1443394a-1d19-4f54-a729-99897b8ff7d3_0(1" alt="u8296664269_massive_steampunk_mechanical_village_mut_huts_str_1443394a-1d19-4f54-a729-99897b8ff7d3_0(1).png" class="content-image">.png)<p><Downtown Ironheart><p><h3>III. The Battlefield</h3><p>Then…</p><p><p>The horns blared.</p><p><p>A deep, booming roar ; like the bellows of a molten god ; erupted from brass towers above the city. Then another. Then two more, echoing across Ironheart like a call to arms.</p><p><p>Chaos unfolded instantly.</p><p><p>Rhonza townsfolk dropped what they were doing ; wheelbarrows clattered to the side, crates of ingots spilled across the street, an anvil rolled off a cart and slammed into the gutter with a thunderous clang.</p><p><p>“What the hell is happening?” Dallas muttered.</p><p><p>Haoyu’s head whipped around, trying to parse the commotion.</p><p><p>From every forge-door and corner shop, Rhonza rushed into the square, donning leather aprons, iron-studded chainmail, hastily fastening armor pieces and pulling weapons from racks: forge-hammers, blade-hooks, molten-blades still steaming from their scabbards.</p><p><p>Then like an invisible force parting water ; the crowd split down the middle.</p><p><p>A battalion marched through.</p><p><p>A hundred Rhonza ; uniformed, elite, brutal. Their plated armor painted ceremonial-red, adorned in gleaming filigree and steam-vented exhaust ports, helm-crests of razor-sharp spikes glowing in rhythmic pulses of orange light.</p><p><p>“Sweet mother of steam…” Dallas whispered.</p><p><p>Each soldier carried a warhammer, battle axe or claymore the size of a man. Some bore cannon-like rifles on their backs, others lugged shoulder-slung bows and seismic polearms that rippled with kinetic glyphs.</p><p><p>The entire square thundered under their synchronized march, boots pounding iron against stone.</p><p><p>Behind them, townsfolk ; no longer merchants and smiths but militia ; scrambled to follow. With only leather jerkin, scorched mail, and tools-turned-weapons, they yelled and shoved their way toward the front gates, where the horns had signaled an incoming assault.</p><p><p>“We need to move ” Haoyu began, but it was already too late.</p><p><p>They were caught in the stampede.</p><p><p>Dozens of Rhonza pushed past, grunting orders, barking in their clanging, steam-infused tongue. Haoyu and Dallas were nearly flattened by a passing trebuchet being rolled through the market like a toy car.</p><p><p>“To the wall! TO THE WALL!” a horned woman screamed, holding a steel-spear with a sack of throwing shrapnel slung over her back.</p><p><p>“Shit this way!” Dallas yanked Haoyu by the arm, the two of them forced to huddle in the corner between two brass columns framing an arched stonework.</p><p><p>They pressed back against a copper drainpipe and watched the endless stream of war-bound bodies thunder past.</p><p><p>Then… silence.</p><p><p>Within minutes, the square was empty.</p><p><p>Scattered metal still clattered against the stone as wind pushed over abandoned carts. A tool rack fell over in the distance. Smoke from a toppled incense kiln curled lazily in the air.</p><p><p>Only the echo of distant shouting remained ; and the growing drumbeats of war from outside the city walls.</p><p><p>Haoyu caught his breath, blinking in the sudden stillness.</p><p><p>“We need to decide,” he said. “Do we follow them? See what they’re facing?”</p><p><p>Dallas still watched the direction the soldiers had marched off in.</p><p><p>“Could be nothin’. Could be… a dream-version of some tribal skirmish. But…” he squinted toward the gates.</p><p><p>“I got a bad feelin’. This ain’t just some fantasy war.”</p><p><p>Haoyu looked back toward the Chuckwagon Café ; still just sitting there in the square, like some glitch in the world’s logic.</p><p><p>“I think we were shown this for a reason,” he said. “And whatever they’re about to fight… maybe it’s what we’re here to see.”</p><p><p>Dallas nodded.</p><p><p>“Let’s find out what’s knockin’ on Ferron’s front door.”</p><p><p>And with that, they stepped out of the alley ; into the emptied square ; and followed the path toward the frontlines.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2022%20-%20Ferron/480890966_122228794256031351_4867928752944371320_n.jpg" alt="480890966_122228794256031351_4867928752944371320_n.jpg" class="content-image"><p><Battalions lining up in formation><p>They scrambled through the abandoned square, boots clanging over dropped tools and scattered forge-gear. The distant sounds of war were growing louder now ; not just horns, but the deep, metallic thunder of impact, the rumble of siege, and the howl of voices raised in fury.</p><p><p>The city gates loomed ahead ; high, fortified walls of bronze-laced stone, the gateway sealed tight with a lattice of iron-reinforced timber.</p><p><p>But it wasn’t the gate they were after.</p><p><p>Just to the right, a spiral staircase twisted upward into a tower carved from blackstone and bolted with steam vents and anchor chains. A watchtower, high above the walls ; with a view over the battlefield.</p><p><p>“C’mon,” Dallas said, already bounding up the steps one at a time.</p><p><p>“These steps are huge… like for giants” Panted Haoyu.</p><p><p>The climb felt endless, their legs burning, breath shallow. The air grew hotter with every step, the vibrations of the distant battle shaking the very walls.</p><p><p>And then ; they reached the top.</p><p><p>They stepped out onto the open platform, and their hearts froze.</p><p><p>Below them, spread out across a jagged plain of slag and ash, was war.</p><p><p>Real war.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2022%20-%20Ferron/u8296664269_vast_battlefield_medieval_minotaurs_trebuchet_cat_91481f6f-3d96-4953-a7d0-532204892201_3.png" alt="u8296664269_vast_battlefield_medieval_minotaurs_trebuchet_cat_91481f6f-3d96-4953-a7d0-532204892201_3.png" class="content-image"><p><A trebuchet fires debris and shrapnel as the war rages on><p>Not a dreamlike metaphor. Not some surreal memory puzzle. This was full-blown, brutal medieval carnage; and it was alive.</p><p><p>The city of Ironheart had unleashed hell.</p><p><p>Across the battlefield, two massive Rhonza armies clashed in a thunderous storm of steel and flame.</p><p><p>Trebuchets, fashioned from wrought-copper and bonewood, hurled molten boulders the size of wagons across the field. They landed in plumes of fire, crushing warriors and turning earth to glass.</p><p><p>Catapults launching cauldrons of molten metals, flinging them like a water balloons across the plains, exploding onto soldiers who screamed in agony as they literally melted into the ground.</p><p><p>Arrow carts; rolling ballistae mounted with dozens of bows; launched synchronized hailstorms of metal spears that darkened the sky before raining death on the opposing army.</p><p><p>Rhonza skinning each other alive, decapitations, limbs hacked off, skulls bashed in… it was a horrific sight to behold.</p><p><p>The opposing force ; a rival Rhonza faction with imperial-blue painted armor and turquoise threaded emblems waving from battle standards ; had their own elite warriors, siege engines, hurling serrated spires and shattering the earth with rupture explosives that left glowing cracks in the terrain.</p><p><p>A massive enemy steam engine tank rolled onto the field, blasting an artillery shell into a pit of skirmish, disintegrating Rhonza into ground meat infused with metal, sending ripped apart bodies flying like ragdolls across the sky.</p><p><p>Haoyu and Dallas watched as the elite red-armored battalion ; the same soldiers that had marched past them in the market ; surged forward like a menacing living machines.</p><p><p>Their massive battle axes split bodies in half. Their furnace-swords carved smoking trails through enemy formations. One of them windmilled with a warhammer, spinning through a crowd of blue-armored warriors like a pendulum of judgment.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2022%20-%20Ferron/480805835_122228208596031351_2828057899386139952_n.jpg" alt="480805835_122228208596031351_2828057899386139952_n.jpg" class="content-image"><p>The noise was unbearable.</p><p><p>The battle cries. The agonizing screams. The crunch of metal. The clanking of swords against shields and plates. The firing and exploding of artillery. The guttural cries of Rhonza warriors dying for causes that Haoyu and Dallas didn’t even begin to understand.</p><p><p>“Jesus Christ…” Haoyu whispered, gripping the edge of the tower wall.</p><p><p>Dallas was speechless. Eyes wide. Jaw tight.</p><p><p>Haoyu leaned over the edge.</p><p><p>His breath caught.</p><p><p>Eyes widened.</p><p><p>Jaw slackened.</p><p><p>And something inside him ; deep in his spine ; shivered.</p><p><p>Dallas noticed.</p><p><p>“You alright, partner? All this war is too much ain’t it?” he asked, edging closer.</p><p><p>Haoyu didn’t answer.</p><p><p>He just raised a trembling hand… and pointed.</p><p><p>Dallas followed his gaze.</p><p><p>And froze.</p><p><p>There, at the center of the battlefield, in the blood-slicked heart of the chaos, stood something that did not belong.</p><p><p>Not a Rhonza. Not an Oc’Xari. Not a human.</p><p><p>Not anything of this world.</p><p><p>It stood atop a pile of broken bodies ; as if it had emerged from the carnage, birthed from slaughter.</p><p><p>A towering flesh-beast, its skin bloated and pus-slicked, bulging in places like it was filled with rotting gas. It stood on three legs, crooked and unnaturally jointed, with two massive arms, long enough to drag against the ground ; the hands a fusion of hoof and claw.</p><p><p>Its head was unmistakably in the shape of a <strong>pig.</strong></p><p><p>Tusks curled forward from a snouted mouth that did not breathe ; and horns jutted from its scalp, not symmetrical, not organic, but warped like melted iron.</p><p><p>Its eyes ; if you could call them that ; were holes, black and bottomless, fixed directly on Haoyu and Dallas.</p><p><p>It wasn’t thrashing. It wasn’t rampaging.</p><p><p>It was still and silent, like a statue, from over 100 meters away, watching Haoyu and Dallas.</p><p><p>“No...” Haoyu muttered, voice shaking. “No, that’s impossible.”</p><p><p>Dallas stepped back, instinctively clutching his chest ; as if the thing had already reached it’s presence inside him.</p><p><p>He swallowed hard.</p><p><p>“That’s the Pig I saw… back in the saloon on Nhexus…”</p><p><p>Dallas backed toward the wall of the tower, eyes locked to the pit.</p><p><p>“It’s looking right at us.”</p><p><p>The beast didn’t move.</p><p><p><strong>But suddenly Everything else… stopped.</strong><p>The chaos of war ; the clashing of steel, the cries of pain, the roar of catapults ; halted.</p><p><p>Rhonza soldiers froze mid-strike, blades locked in the air.</p><p><p>Smoke stopped rising.</p><p><p>Embers stopped flickering.</p><p><p>The wind stopped blowing.</p><p><p>The entire battlefield went dead ; like someone had pressed pause on reality.</p><p><p>Only the Pig remained animate.</p><p><p>Still staring.</p><p><p>Still watching.</p><p><p>Dallas didn’t breathe. Neither did Haoyu.</p><p><p>And then</p><p><p>The voice came.</p><p><p>It didn’t echo.</p><p><p>It didn’t vibrate through air.</p><p><p>It pounded through their bones.</p><p><p>A voice so low, so thunderous, it felt like it came from beneath the world, dragging fire and ash in its wake.</p><p><p>"You do not belong here mortal."</p><p><p>The sky above them darkened unnaturally.</p><p><p>A pressure fell on their chests, like invisible chains.</p><p><p>"You chase stars and scratch at doors that were never meant to open."</p><p><p>The Pig still hadn’t moved.</p><p><p>But the voice… was coming from it.</p><p><p>Through it.</p><p><p>Or from something inside it.</p><p><p>"You mortals are meddling in business beyond your comprehension."</p><p><p>"You scoured Nhexus.

Swift Current Ranch - 4:21 AM</h3><p>Haoyu jerked awake, gasping for breath.</p><p><p>His chest heaved like he’d just been pulled from a freezing lake.</p><p><p>His shirt clung to his skin, drenched in sweat. Beside him, his wife stirred groggily, murmuring his name in concern ; but he couldn’t speak yet.</p><p><p>He sat upright on the makeshift bedroll, heart pounding.</p><p><p>The smell of hay. Wood. A sliver of moonlight through the window. The real world.</p><p><p>But it didn’t feel real.</p><p><p>Across the room, just outside the faint glow of the nightlight… someone was watching him.</p><p><p>Dmitry.</p><p><p>Seated in the kitchen chair, facing him silently. Still. Pale.</p><p><p>His tablet; covered in analog sensors, antennae, and etched coil rings ; hummed quietly in his lap, lit with dozens of warning glyphs.</p><p><p>Haoyu blinked, trying to get words out.</p><p><p>Dmitry stood slowly.</p><p><p>“You were gone for a while,” he said, voice hushed and flat.</p><p><p>“Two hours. Maybe more.”</p><p><p>Haoyu’s throat was dry.</p><p><p>“...Gone?” he croaked.</p><p><p>Dmitry didn’t blink.</p><p><p>“There was something standing over you the whole time. Shadow... thin. Elongated. Same morphology we saw on Nhexus in the crater footage from Echofall Day 76.”</p><p><p>Haoyu stared at him.</p><p><p>Dmitry continued:</p><p><p>“It never moved. It just… touched your head. Watched you.”
” I sat down on this chair, and it glanced at me- started watching me.”</p><p><p>“I watched it back.”</p><p><p>“We didn’t speak. And there was no aggression, just watching each other.”</p><p><p>He stepped slightly closer, lowering his voice:</p><p><p>“At one point, you were squirming, and it looked at me, and it looked like it was touching it’s temple, and trying to communicate something to me - it didn’t seem evil in it’s intent, seemed like it was trying to show you something.”</p><p><p>Haoyu rubbed his face, trembling.</p><p><p>“I saw it.”</p><p><p>Dmitry tilted his head.</p><p><p>“What did you see?”</p><p><p>Haoyu nodded, then exhaled shakily.</p><p><p>“I was on this planet called Ferron. A whole world of iron and flame. There was a battle. Massive. Ancient. Terrifying.”</p><p><p>He paused.</p><p><p>Then, voice low and rattled:</p><p><p>“And in the middle of it all… I saw it again. The same pig-like thing from another dream I have back on Nhexus. But instead of in the Saloon, the Pig was standing on a mound of corpses. It didn’t fight. Didn’t move. Just… watched us.”</p><p><p>Dmitry remained still.</p><p><p>“Did it do anything?”</p><p><p>“Yeah, it spoke to us this time” Haoyu whispered.</p><p><p>He looked down, breath shallow.</p><p><p>“It told us we’d seen too much. That the map… wasn’t meant for us. That something older than life itself was watching now. And then it screamed; told us to get out.”</p><p><p>Dmitry slowly sat back down.</p><p><p>“They’ve followed us through the data. Through the probe. Through the signal. Now… through the dreams.”</p><p><p>He looked out the window at the prairie moonlight.</p><p><p>“Echofall wasn’t just a project.”</p><p><p>“It opened a door to another world, and now it’s left wide open.”</p><p><p>Haoyu’s voice trailed off.</p><p><p>He sat still for a long moment, trying to hold onto the last flickers of that infernal battlefield ; the warmth of the forge winds, the piercing silence that followed the beast’s command.</p><p><p>Dmitry stood slowly, the faint chime of his device now rising in pitch ; the interface blinking with overlapping coordinate arcs and waveforms, displayed in holographic pulses across the cracked screen.</p><p><p>He tapped the side of it, pulled up the map.</p><p><p>And there it was.</p><p><p>A line.</p><p><p>A glowing trajectory slashing through the simulated cosmos of known and hypothesized systems ; originating somewhere just beyond Ferron’s modeled cluster. The endpoint?</p><p><p>A bright coordinate blip hovering in Haoyu’s region of the bed.</p><p><p>Dmitry turned the screen toward him.</p><p><p>“The moment you entered REM,” he said, voice steady, “this device began capturing... a transmission.”</p><p><p>“Not radio. Not subspace. Something deeper. Something laced into particle resonance.”</p><p><p>He paused, then clarified:</p><p><p>“Your mind ; your body ; was generating an emission.”</p><p><p>“The map registered it. The same kind of pulse signature as the Oc’Xari guitar when we analyzed it yesterday.”</p><p><p>“But this time… there was a destination ping.”</p><p><p>He tapped the glowing node.</p><p><p>“Ferron. Not metaphorically. Not in dream logic. Literally, physically, cosmologically real. Your consciousness made contact with a fixed location in space.”</p><p><p>Haoyu blinked.</p><p><p>“We... projected?”</p><p><p>Dmitry nodded once.</p><p><p>“Like quantum resonance through folded memory-space. Your brain is being used like a tuning fork ; like an anchor. Something out there is pulling you in, using the guitar’s signature as a conduit.”</p><p><p>He flicked to another screen ; jagged spikes of frequency activity.</p><p><p>“You weren’t imagining the battlefield. Or the Pig-Beast. Or the city.”</p><p><p>“Those places exist.”</p><p><p>“And Oc’Xari entity ; is bringing you there, like its trying to show you something.”</p><p><p>He looked back up, face pale but unwavering.</p><p><p>“These aren’t dreams, Commander.”</p><p><p>“They’re transits.”</p><p><p>Haoyu’s stomach sank.</p><p><p>“So when it said we weren’t supposed to be there…”</p><p><p>Dmitry’s expression tightened grimly.</p><p><p>“It meant it. Whatever this is ; it’s more ancient than Oc’Xari, more dangerous than anything Echofall imagined. You’ve been seen, Haoyu.”</p><p><p>He looked toward the hallway.</p><p><p>“And if it’s watching us in our own sleep…”</p><p><p>“…it’s already here.”</p><p>
