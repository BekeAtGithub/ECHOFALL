                <h1>Chapter 40 - Banff</h1><h3><strong>I. Yoho</strong></h3><p><strong>1 day till the deadline</strong><p>Dmitry and Steven woke up in their tent, side by side, stiff and sore but alive. The canvas above them creaked from the residual wind, a low murmur compared to the roaring storms of nights prior.</p><p><p>Steven groaned, rubbing the sleep from his eyes - looking over at Dmitry, who had what looked something like an alien cellphone on his chest - <em>the Kavariin artifact.</em></p><p><p>“You’ve got a tough choice to make, cowboy. If you give the artifact to the Pig, you get to roll back time and save the world from all this bullshit. If you put that artifact inside the other artifact you save an alien civilization and unite them with humanity… but, I’ll be gone, and you’d better have a good reason for my sacrifice.”</p><p><p>Dmitry sat up slowly, blinking into the pale blue morning light. His breath steamed faintly in the air. For a moment, he didn’t answer.</p><p><p>Then, softly:</p><p><p>“Why me?” he said, voice low and hollow. “Why the fuck is this my decision?”</p><p><p>He looked down at his weather-worn hands. Calloused. Trembling.</p><p><p>“I’m not chosen. I’m not holy. I’m just a washed-up engineer. A janitor, for god’s sake. A Russian immigrant with a criminal record now, drawer full of unpaid bills and  broken dreams.”</p><p><p>Steven didn’t respond. He just exhaled and patted Dmitry’s shoulder.</p><p><p>They packed up quietly, their bodies aching as they hoisted the sled once again and resumed their march. The air had changed. There was a crispness, yes; but beneath it, warmth.</p><p><p>About six kilometers from Banff, the first beams of sun pierced the thinning cloud cover. With each kilometer closer, the world seemed to thaw.</p><p><p>Puddles pooled in the edges of the road, rivulets of meltwater streaming through the snowbanks. They unzipped their jackets ; finally ; and rolled up their sleeves.</p><p><p>A few patches of green emerged along the roadside like secrets long buried.</p><p><p>By the time they crossed into the town center of Banff, it didn’t even feel like the same world. Snow still clung to rooftops and hillsides, but the air was gentle, even sweet. A breeze carried the scent of pine and spring runoff.</p><p><p>They stopped near a wide civic park at the edge of the main strip ; kids laughing in the distance, someone strumming a guitar nearby, and the sound of dogs barking joyfully in the snow.</p><p><p>They threw their boots off, peeled their jackets, and collapsed shirtless onto a park bench, backs stretched out like sunbathers in July.</p><p><p>Dmitry tilted his face to the sky.</p><p><p>“Is this heaven?” he muttered. “Or just Canada?”</p><p><p>Steven chuckled.</p><p><p>“You know, after the week we had, I’d believe either.”</p><p><p>They sat like that for a long time, letting the warmth soak into their bones.</p><p><p>Eventually, conversation stirred.</p><p><p>“Remember the drug lord?” Steven said, grinning sideways. “I still got blood under my fingernails.”</p><p><p>“I been thinking about it, I think you might have killed him.” Dmitry muttered, eyes still closed. “I thought we were just borrowing his... firearms.”</p><p><p>“We borrowed everything, right? The guns. The car. The ski gear. The dignity.”</p><p><p>They both laughed.</p><p><p>Then Steven added:</p><p><p>“And let’s not forget the train.”</p><p><p>Dmitry groaned, covering his face.</p><p><p>“The Amtrak heist,” he said. “We were two grown men hiding behind crates of produce like cartoon criminals.”</p><p><p>Steven held up a finger.</p><p><p>“Don’t forget the cop in Revelstoke who thought he was hosting a travel brochure.”</p><p><p>Dmitry mimicked the officer’s voice in perfect sarcasm.</p><p><p>“‘You’ll love it here, folks. Take a look at our steakhouses, craft breweries, and scenic fucking death blizzards.’”</p><p><p>“Then there was the cute barista girl in Golden,” Steven added wistfully. “She thought we were trust fund idiots on a survival challenge retreat.”</p><p><p>Dmitry smirked.</p><p><p>“We are idiots. Just not the trust fund kind.”</p><p><p>They went quiet for a moment. The sun dipped lower, casting long amber shadows on the melting pavement. Children shouted in the background. A bus rumbled lazily by. Somewhere, a bird sang.</p><p><p>“And then the dream,” Dmitry murmured.</p><p><p>Steven’s smile faded. He sat up a little straighter.</p><p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p><p>“That Avaris,” he continued. “Like... a damn statue carved from light.”</p><p><p>“And the Oc’Xari... not even sure how to describe it. But it felt... honest. Like it wasn’t lying. Just... different.”</p><p><p>Dmitry nodded slowly.</p><p><p>“And the Pig...”</p><p><p>They both went quiet again.</p><p><p>“He’s not just evil,” Steven said. “He’s something else. Like rot that thinks it’s doing good.”</p><p><p>“Like mushrooms and flies that eat up the dead to keep the world clean” Dmitry added.</p><p><p>A moment passed.</p><p><p>“So... what are you gonna do?” Steven finally asked.</p><p><p>Dmitry didn’t answer.</p><p><p>He just stared forward, eyes fixed towards a sign pointing towards the highway out of Banff, the long stretch toward the rising prairie, toward the artifact, toward Swift Current... toward whatever waited in the end.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2040%20-%20Banff/banff.jpg" alt="banff.jpg" class="content-image"><p><h3><strong>II. Borrowing things… lots of things…</strong></h3><p>Steven leaned back, arms sprawled along the sun-warmed bench, the light glinting off the melted snow pooling around their bare feet.</p><p><p>Dmitry pulled his shirt over his head, still eyeing the highway sign.</p><p><p>“So,” he muttered, brushing sweat from his brow, “how are we going to steal a car in broad daylight?”</p><p><p>Steven sat up, scratched the back of his neck, and grinned that crooked, swamp-boy grin.</p><p><p>“Alright, now hear me out,” he began, slipping effortlessly into full-blown Florida logic.</p><p><p>“Back home, we used to bait gators by tossin’ rotisserie chickens in the lake with fishin’ hooks tied to 'em. Worked every time.”</p><p><p>Dmitry blinked.</p><p><p>“...And what’s that got to do with cars?”</p><p><p>Steven leaned in, lowering his voice like he was hatching the plan of the century.</p><p><p>“You ever seen rich tourists in mountain towns? They all leave their keys in them fancy SUVs when they’re runnin’ in to grab a chai latte or some vegan moose jerky or whatever. We just find one that’s still warm, toss a backpack on the windshield like we’re makin’ a delivery, and when they step out to check it—BAM. One of us jumps in and goes, the other plays dumb and wanders off like a confused hiker.”</p><p><p>Dmitry stared for a beat.</p><p><p>“That’s your plan.”</p><p><p>Steven nodded proudly.</p><p><p>“It’s Banff-proof, baby.”</p><p><p>“...And what if it fails?”</p><p><p>Steven shrugged.</p><p><p>“Then we improvise. Worst case, I start screamin’ in tongues and pretend I’m a Bigfoot that got turned into a man by a cursed glacier. Canadians’ll leave you alone real quick if they think you’re insane.”</p><p><p>Dmitry sighed through a chuckle, rubbing his temples.</p><p><p>“You’re an idiot.”</p><p><p>“A useful idiot,” Steven said, tapping the side of his head. “Now let’s go find us a warm engine and a dumb latte.”</p><p><p>They stood, gathering their gear, sunshine still gleaming off their high-tech jackets, water dripping from their boots ; two half-broken fugitives, heading off to rob a suburban SUV like it was the fate of the galaxy.</p><p><p>Because, somehow, it was.</p><p><p>They scouted for a while.</p><p><p>Banff wasn’t huge; quaint and touristy, stitched together with boutiques, rental shops, and overfunded espresso cafes. It was the kind of town that dressed up its fire hydrants with little scarves in winter.</p><p><p>Which made it <em>perfect</em>.</p><p><p>Dmitry and Steven split up across opposite corners of the small shopping district. No one questioned them ; they looked the part of eccentric backcountry hikers, all kitted out in thousand-dollar Archon survival tech. A few tourists even nodded respectfully, mistaking them for some kind of pro Arctic ultramarathoners.</p><p><p>Steven found it first.</p><p><p>A <strong>gleaming silver SUV</strong> - late model, electric hybrid, with solar panels etched into the roof and tires still wet from melted snow. Parked sloppily in front of a trendy restaurant named <em>The Grizzly House</em>. The engine was still humming.</p><p><p>Steven peaked at the lunch menu out front on the roadside.</p><p><p>“$80 for Rattlesnake fondue?! I can get a snake in the swamp for free down in Fort Myers!” 
”Blyet, what kind of person spends $20 on a salad…” added Dmitry
”The type of person about to get their nice SUV stolen.” Steven sneered</p><p><p>Inside, a man in a pastel vest and snowboarding goggles on his forehead was fiddling with his phone in line, waiting on expensive meats.</p><p><p>Steven, watching from across the street, whispered into the comm piece he'd found tucked in their gear bag:</p><p><p>“Lex. I got a fish. Big dumb trout. Key's prob’ly still in the dash.”</p><p><p>“You sure?” Dmitry replied, eyes scanning the street from a covered alleyway.</p><p><p>“You ever see a man with ski goggles wearin’ ‘em indoors? That’s not a thinker.”</p><p><p>“Alright. Do it.”</p><p><p>Steven grabbed a delivery backpack they'd kept for exactly this reason ; a faded green bag that looked like it used to deliver pizza in a city three provinces away. He sauntered across the street, casual, limping a bit like his legs were sore from climbing glaciers (they <em>were</em>), and dropped the bag square on the SUV’s windshield. He knocked on the hood, pretending to squint at a receipt.</p><p><p>The tourist inside the restaurant took the bait. Confused, then annoyed, he stepped out to yell something like <em>“I didn’t order anything!”</em></p><p><p>At that exact moment - Dmitry moved.</p><p><p>Clean, smooth, controlled.</p><p><p>He slid into the driver’s seat, already wearing gloves, eyes scanning for any anti-theft measures. Found the start pad. Pressed it.</p><p><p>The SUV didn’t complain. It purred.</p><p><p>Steven shrugged, nodded politely to the guy, muttered something about “wrong address” and jogged off down the alley just as Dmitry eased the vehicle into motion.</p><p><p>Steven leapt in at the next intersection, slamming the door shut behind him, both of them bursting into laughter as the mountains rolled by on either side.</p><p><p>“You actually dropped a delivery bag on the hood,” Dmitry said, steering onto the ice-slick highway.</p><p><p>“Told ya. Rich folks see logos and immediately assume reality.”</p><p><p>“And if he called the cops?”</p><p><p>“Then they’ll be lookin’ for two wilderness rescue rangers from Nova Scotia deliverin’ vegan rotisserie chickens. We’re ghosts, baby.”</p><p><p>They merged onto the Trans-Canada Highway, heading east. Banff faded behind them. The peaks glistened like frozen teeth in the rearview mirror.</p><p><p>Ahead ; open road. Clear skies.</p><p>
