                <h1>Chapter 2 - Slop Life</h1>As we started Chapter 1 with a familiar, easy going, pleasant world of many similarities, let’s take a 180 turn. This is a world where evolution failed <em>constantly</em>.</p><p><p>If you have a weak stomach - perhaps, skip this chapter.</p><p><p>This story is heinous, putrid and slow.</p><p><p>"Most LUCA-seeded planets died because life was too slow, too fragile, or too bold.
On Nhexus however, life flourished… but it shouldn’t have. 
The seed was damaged, and there was probably something wrong with the planet, too."</p><p><p><h2><strong>Nhexus - The Slop Planet</strong></h2><p><h3>I. Planet Overview</h3><p><ul>
<li><strong>Size:</strong> 1.05 Earth radius</li>
<li><strong>Gravity:</strong> 0.96G</li>
<li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Ammonia-thick, caustic vapor pockets, acidic rainfall</li>
<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Moderate but chemically unstable</li>
<li><strong>Surface:</strong> Soft, spongey terrain; prone to organic rot crusts</li>
<li><strong>Oceans:</strong> Shallow toxic brine seas laced with dissolved proteins and alcohols</li>
</ul><p>Nhexus began like many LUCA worlds ; fertile, warm, chemically diverse.</p><p><p>But at the molecular level, life was already unclean.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%202%20-%20Slop%20Life/arsheapriestess_57403_numenera_style_chaotic_alien_landscape_wi_69b46e73-6acb-474a-9d90-f7081cfea4a1.png" alt="arsheapriestess_57403_numenera_style_chaotic_alien_landscape_wi_69b46e73-6acb-474a-9d90-f7081cfea4a1.png" class="content-image"><p><Early landscapes of Nhexus><p><h3>II. The Age of Slop</h3><p><h3>~100–800 million years post-LUCA</h3><p>This LUCA Seed must have been flawed in production… or perhaps tainted during it’s trip to Nhexus.</p><p><p>Early life crawled from mucosal brine pits and formed squirming blankets across swamp-crusts littered with all types of insects.</p><p><p>These organisms lacked structure. They often:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Vomited excess proteins their cells couldn’t fold correctly</li>
<li>Grew half-formed limbs that detached and rotted</li>
<li>Developed reversible nervous systems, causing pain when touched or thinking</li>
</ul><p>Many had no rear end, so waste was expelled from skin pores or from their faces, creating trails of pus, blood, excrement and other bodily fluids - some of those fluids would result in unintentional reproduction.</p><p><p>Those that grew larger:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Developed skull-walls that never closed, leaving brains partially exposed, being vulnerable to all sorts of parasites, diseases and plagues</li>
<li>Grew eyes on inward-facing stalks, forcing vision into themselves</li>
<li>Used tongues to walk, dragging themselves by taste muscle</li>
</ul><p>Each lineage became only more ridden with evolutionary failures.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%202%20-%20Slop%20Life/480913718_122228762360031351_3887249303421508005_n.jpg" alt="480913718_122228762360031351_3887249303421508005_n.jpg" class="content-image"><p><Nhexus spawning pool with Spine-Lanterns><p><h3>III. Pre-Slop Evolution</h3><p>Around Year 900M, Nhexus entered its pre-peak peak of complexity.</p><p><p>The most “successful” clade were the Pre-Slops:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>These creatures created small buildings by vomiting sludge that would harden. They would regurgitate layers upon layers to create structures.</li>
<li>When Slops were impregnated, they often died birthing, as their frail bodies couldn’t handle birth, often resulting in obliterating more than half of their body. However, a single birthing resulted in a spawning pool with dozens of new Slops to live out their bleak existence of suffering.</li>
</ul><p>Competing fauna included:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Spine-lanterns: glow from their own spinal fluid, which acted as light sources, would often be an easy night target for a hungry predator</li>
<li>Gullet-Crabs: This planet also evolved into many species of crabs which thrived in slop swamp pools and brine pits</li>
<li>Lurch-Buds: plants that gave birth to root-children, which grew into all sorts of bizarre flora</li>
</ul><p>One species, the Crawling Shiver, would constantly scream ; not in pain, but as an accidental output of their sensory nerves brushing against internal teeth-like growths in the chest cavity.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%202%20-%20Slop%20Life/481078418_122228842190031351_6779376410322222206_n.jpg" alt="481078418_122228842190031351_6779376410322222206_n.jpg" class="content-image"><p><The Djormo><p><h3>IV. The Gut-War Epoch</h3><p>Multiple proto-sentient lifeforms branched out in peak complexity from the Pre-Slop species, massive battles emerged due to the differences between the sub-specimen factions;</p><p><p><h3><em>The Djormo:</em></h3><p><ul>
<li>Grew “brain-puddles” that sloshed around the inside of their skulls, reacting to gravity</li>
<li>Could mimic sounds but not retain memory ; they wept constantly, not consciously knowing why</li>
</ul><p><h3><em>The Ossari:</em></h3><p><ul>
<li>Developed intelligent skeletal brains, not a brain inside a skull, but a brain entangled as a nerve-gland system throughout their body ; understanding concepts of curiosity, and serving a greater purpose for their communities</li>
<li>Reproduced by building walls from organic material, the males would then ejaculate all over the walls, where the females came to impregnate themselves on the wall</li>
<li>The Ossaris bodies could morph together with large quantities of Ossari into “Flesh Structures” they would form grotesque pyramids, obelisks, houses and even megastructure’s such as skyscrapers which would house a variety of species on the planet. Once a building would be formed - they would slowly start to die as their skin would harden, and fossilize in place. A notable megastructure/sloptech was a gigantic scope with a thousand eyes bulging out towards space - like a space observatory - they would study the stars the way humans would.</li>
<li>The Ossari would also be known to morph families together into vehicles serving as logistics transportation</li>
</ul><p><h3><em>The Slops:</em></h3><p><ul>
<li>The Slops mentioned from earlier lived on and eventually evolved proboscis mouthparts that injected parasitic slop into others to control them</li>
<li>This evolution was crucial to the slops becoming the dominant species - using their new biology as a weapon to enslave the other species to provide for the Slops</li>
<li>The parasites they’d inject into other species, would eventually evolve to also infect the Slops who started the parasites, and eventually these parasites formed a flesh hivemind and dominated the planet before dying out due to the Great Sludge Storm</li>
</ul><p><h3>V. The Great Sludge Storm</h3><p>Nhexus didn’t end through war or famine.</p><p><p>In its final million years:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>The skies turned dark from ammonia clouds</li>
<li>Superstorms began violently creating tsunamis, tornados and hurricanes of sludge, ravaging large portions of the planet</li>
<li>These storms are thought to have been a reaction caused by their home sun collapsing and fading into a white dwarf, because after some time- the storms stopped suddenly as the atmosphere of Nhexus faded - not completely but enough for weather and life to die out</li>
</ul><p>Many who study this planet believe the Great Sludge Storm was the best event that happened in the universe… They wish it would have come sooner to lay mercy and peace upon this horrific abomination of misfortunate evolutionary mutations.</p><p><p><h3>VI. Legacy</h3><p>Once the sludge storm has passed - the air cleared, and the sludge washed away, the atmosphere of the planet has mostly died, and for over hundreds of thousands of years - not a single wind storm swept the lands, no weather, no storms, thus; all fossils and remnants left over from the storm have been perfectly preserved.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%202%20-%20Slop%20Life/aldarion109_the_gene_devourer_--chaos_17_--profile_91nuuov_--st_4d51eccc-0705-44e5-8996-7aa295b335e3.png" alt="aldarion109_the_gene_devourer_--chaos_17_--profile_91nuuov_--st_4d51eccc-0705-44e5-8996-7aa295b335e3.png" class="content-image"><p><A Slop and it’s parasite probing a Ghorjora>
