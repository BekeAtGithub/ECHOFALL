                <h1>Chapter 23 - The Donkey</h1><h3>I. <strong>Day 2 & 3: The Lab, The Ranch, The Raid and The Mystical Six Legged Donkey</strong></h3><p>The morning after the Ferron dream, the crew gathered in the barn around Dmitry’s tablet -reviewing everything.</p><p><p>Frequency patterns. Energy waves. Gravitational bleed.</p><p><p>Dmitry’s voice was calm but firm as he ran them through it all:</p><p><p>“This wasn’t just a dream. There were emissions. Echoes in the Schumann resonance bands. I charted it. We can triangulate the entrypoint.”</p><p><p>Haoyu rubbed his temple, exhausted and electrified all at once.</p><p><p>“So this… Ferron… was real. We were there.”</p><p><p>Dmitry didn’t answer. He just tapped the map ; a faint glowing line drawn from Earth to a coordinate far outside the Kuiper Belt.</p><p><p>By 10:00 AM, the crew had split up into work roles.</p><p><p>Steven took the rental car, heading into Swift Current for bulk gear ; monitors, folding tables, ethernet spools, surge batteries, and whatever sleeping gear the local stores had.</p><p><p>Yuyan took Dallas’ F1 truck, cruising slow and steady down the dusty roads with a shopping list of his own ; conduit wire, microwave components, copper spools, and antenna tubing. He said he could probably make a satellite uplink “if given some foil and enough faith.”</p><p><p>Dallas handed him some gas money and pointed him to the old supply road into town.</p><p><p>“Try not to get pulled over. Pretty sure that truck’s got 1949 plates.” Dallas remarked.</p><p><p>“But she sings.” Yuyan replied.</p><p><p>The rest of the day was spent building.</p><p><p>The barn filled with the sound of drills, bolt-tighteners, and the occasional "ow!" from Steven when he dropped a battery on his foot.</p><p><p>Desks were rigged up. A generator wired to solar input.</p><p><p>By sundown, the workspace felt like a command center.</p><p><p>Evening came. Dinner was quiet, filled with subdued jokes and tired glances.</p><p><p>The stars twinkled over the prairie sky.</p><p><p>No dreams that night.</p><p><p>Day 3 came peacefully.</p><p><p>The kids ran around the farmhouse, sword-fighting with twigs, shrieking with laughter.</p><p><p>Dallas handed out chore duties with a half-serious smirk.</p><p><p>“If y’all are settin’ up shop here, you’re gonna earn your keep.”</p><p><p>Pragnya mucked out the goat pen.</p><p><p>Dmitry helped replace a fence panel.</p><p><p>Steven rode a tractor for the first time in his life and absolutely loved it.</p><p><p>Haoyu stood on the porch beside his wife, arm draped around her shoulders, watching it all unfold.</p><p><p>“It’s not much,” he said.</p><p><p>“It’s everything,” she replied.</p><p><p>Dinner that night was beans, bread, and quiet contentment.</p><p><p>Another night passed.</p><p><p>Another peaceful, dreamless night.</p><p><p><h3>II. Detainment</h3><p><strong>Day 4</strong> - 5:03 AM.<p>The sun hadn’t yet crested over the frost-tipped fields. The barn lights were off. The wind was still.</p><p><p>Until the pounding came.</p><p><p>Loud. Repetitive. Unrelenting.</p><p><p>BANG. BANG. BANG.</p><p><p>“Open the door! POLICE! OPEN UP!”</p><p><p>Children screamed.</p><p><p>Dallas was already halfway down the stairs, hair a mess, reaching to open the front door.</p><p><p>“Hold on! What in god’s-”</p><p><p>The door exploded inward, smashing into Dallas’s chest like a battering ram. It launched him across the kitchen, sending him sprawling over a stool and shattering the coffee table.</p><p><p><strong>Flashbang</strong>.<p>A white-hot burst of light and sound detonated in the center of the living room, rattling the very bones of the house.</p><p><p>Haoyu dove instinctively to shield his children, but it was too late ; the shockwave flooded everything. His ears rang like artillery. Vision fractured into afterimages. His kids shrieked in confusion.</p><p><p>“Get on the floor! Hands where we can see them!”</p><p><p>Heavy boots thundered in. Muffled radio commands. Lasers sweeping across every surface. Automatic rifles raised. Every movement barked at. Every voice drowned in chaos.</p><p><p>Before Haoyu could utter a word, he was wrenched to the floor, arm twisted behind his back, metal clicking into place around his wrists.</p><p><p>“Commander Zhang, you’re under federal detainment pending investigation of interstellar trafficking, fraudulent claims unauthorized alien contact, failing to appear in the court of law, and obstruction of classified research property.”</p><p><p>“You have no jurisdiction here!” Dmitry shouted somewhere across the room.</p><p><p>A rifle slammed into his spine. The primary CIA officer pulls out a scroll reading; Certification of Approved Investigation by the Government of Canada</p><p><p>“We do now, bitch.”</p><p><p>The barn lab ; still half-finished, computers all over the place, half loaded into server racks, cables still exposed, coffee cups still half full from the night before; was immediately surrounded.</p><p><p>Agents in black paramilitary suits stormed the threshold, sweeping with sensors, placing seizure tags on:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>The alien guitar, carefully unwrapped and zipped into a triple-sealed biohazard box.</li>
<li>All laptops, antennae, and monitoring relays</li>
<li>Even the custom chairs Yuyan and Steven had spent all day building from scrap</li>
</ul><p>Inside the garage, the 1950 Ford F1 - shining like a dream from another century - was marked “PROPERTY OF JAMES BETHOZ // INTERDIMENSIONAL ASSET TRACKING.”</p><p><p>The plate was removed.</p><p><p>The keys, confiscated.</p><p><p>The entire crew ; Haoyu, Dmitry, Pragnya, Steven, Yuyan ; were marched out individually, still in their pajamas or half-dressed, blinking under the glare of helicopter lights and drone cameras circling overhead.</p><p><p>Dallas - barely conscious and probably had a few ribs broken - hauled off into a separate police truck</p><p><p>Haoyu’s wife clutched their kids close, crying, screaming at the soldiers.</p><p><p>“He didn’t do anything! He’s a scientist! Our kids; our kids are terrified!”</p><p><p>They were separated.</p><p><p>The children were led into a white unmarked car. His wife, tear-streaked and trembling, shoved into the passenger seat of a different cruiser, fighting to keep her eyes on Haoyu.</p><p><p>“Don’t let them take you,” she sobbed. “Don’t you disappear on us.”</p><p><p>Haoyu was thrown into the back of an armored transport, his face pressed against the cold metal bars.</p><p><p>The drive to the facility felt like it took forever.</p><p><p><h3><strong>III. Processing</strong></h3><p>Each crew member was placed in a separate, isolated holding cell ; no communication. No contact.</p><p><p>Bright white lights. Metal benches. Walls so sterile they hurt the eyes.</p><p><p>Interrogations began one by one.</p><p><p><strong>Ex Commander Haoyu Zhang - Former Lead of Project Echofall</strong><p>He was left in the room for nearly an hour.</p><p><p>No clock.</p><p><p>No sound.</p><p><p>Just the soft hum of fluorescent light and the faint static crackle from the observation glass.</p><p><p>When the door finally opened, two men in black suits entered ; crisp, cold, zero insignia. Not even nametags. One carried a tablet. The other, a steel briefcase he never opened.</p><p><p>They sat across from him. No greeting. No handshake.</p><p><p>Just the questions.</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Commander. Why did you run from court?”</p><p><p>Haoyu exhaled slowly.</p><p><p>“I had leads to uncover mysteries beyond what humanity has ever encountered, I was chosen, we don’t even know why! We could reopen the project and bring more evidence to my case in my defence!”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Why did you take a team of laid-off government scientists to a different country to follow an alien signal?”</p><p><p>Haoyu:</p><p><p>“Because I’ve spent half my life chasing signals from a dead planet. And when one of those signals points at your dreams, your house, your wife ; you follow it.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Where did you get the truck?”</p><p><p>Haoyu:</p><p><p>(Dry laugh)</p><p><p>“I have no idea how it got here. I don’t even know how to drive it properly.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Where did the guitar come from?”</p><p><p>Haoyu:</p><p><p>“Dallas said an Oc’Xari just showed up and gave it to him.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“What is the function of the forge-world you referenced in your notes?”</p><p><p>Haoyu leaned forward.</p><p><p>Eyes sharp.</p><p><p>“It’s not a simulation. It’s not just a world. Ferron is a real place ; a whole planet ; we were <em>placed</em> on it, through some astral projection energy.”</p><p><p>“These aren’t hallucinations. They’re interdimensional correspondence. It’s like remoting into a computer<em>.</em>”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Who, or what- is the Pig Entity?”</p><p><p>Haoyu's voice faltered for the first time.</p><p><p>A pause.</p><p><p>“...I don’t know.”</p><p><p>“I don’t have evidence yet, but I don’t think it’s from Ferron or Nhexus, and it’s not an Oc’Xari.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Is it a weapon?”</p><p><p>Haoyu:</p><p><p>“I have no idea what it is.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Are you a threat?”</p><p><p>Haoyu met their eyes. Calm now.</p><p><p>“no, of course not.”</p><p><p>“The Echofall probe didn’t just find life. It woke something up. And now, you’re asking me if I’m the threat? I’m trying to figure it out!”</p><p><p><strong>Dmitry Alexeyev - Lead Systems Engineer, Russian immigrant</strong><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“You were on the original Echofall design committee, correct? The backbone of the signal intelligence platform?”</p><p><p>Dmitry: <em>(grunts, cold and unimpressed)</em></p><p><p>“Ya. I built the backbone. Fed it iron and fire for twenty years while your politicians cut its legs off with red tape and cowardice.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“And you’re claiming the dreams emit quantifiable signals?”</p><p><p>Dmitry: <em>(leans in, knuckles cracked, voice rough as rusted steel)</em></p><p><p>“You listen now. I fought in the Kholm Petrovski battle in Siberia when I was seventeen. Then I built battlefield comms for five governments across three wars. I don’t ‘claim.’ I measure. I log. I triangulate. I have monitoring tools that record actual, repeatable, mathematical data ; measurable waveform bursts, localized field anomalies, synchronized cerebral pulse events.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“What about the entity you claimed to observe in the room?”</p><p><p>Dmitry: <em>(snorts with fury)</em></p><p><p>“Not ‘claimed,’ you imperial idiot. We photographed that shadow thing with the Echofall rover on Nhexus thirteen years ago. We have hard data, real footage, logs signed by your own military subcontractors. I sat three hours watching it stare into the rovers camera. Meanwhile, your analysts were jerking off in fancy offices, not doing shit!”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“You could’ve reported it”</p><p><p>Dmitry: <em>(cuts him off, ice in his tone)</em></p><p><p>“I did. Forty-seven times. Every time? Buried. Redacted. Reassigned. You can probably check your fucking emails and find my submissions.”</p><p><p><strong>Pragnya Reddy - The Systems Engineer and Biologist</strong> sat with arms crossed, still wearing the same hoodie from the farm ; dark circles under her eyes, but spine straight. She didn’t flinch when the agents walked in.<p>Agent:</p><p><p>“You’re the one who re-validated the genome sequencing on the Nhexus samples?”</p><p><p>Pragnya:</p><p><p>“Three times. Independently. In two separate labs. Every nucleotide pattern matched LUCA identifiers within 0.003% variance.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“So you’re claiming life on Earth and life on Nhexus share a common ancestor?”</p><p><p>Pragnya:</p><p><p>“No. I’m proving it.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“You think that justifies violating international data sovereignty and collaborating with fugitives?”</p><p><p>Pragnya: (shrugs)</p><p><p>“I followed the data. It didn’t stop at borders.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“And the guitar? The dreams?”</p><p><p>Pragnya:</p><p><p>“We don’t have the answers to that- we are trying to discover what they mean.”</p><p><p><strong>Steven Young - The Swamp Redneck</strong>, still in shorts and his ridiculous cowboy hat, just smirked through half the interview.<p>“I told you folks I just came to help build a lab. Y’all didn’t say there’d be no moonshine and only jail time.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“You flew from Florida to rural Saskatchewan to build a lab around an alien guitar?”</p><p><p>Steven: <em>(grinning like he’s about to sell a used tractor)</em></p><p><p>“Well I didn’t come for the weather, that’s for damn sure. Cold up here like a gator’s ass in a snowstorm. But yeah, Dallas called. Said there was a magic guitar and possible interdimensional bullshittery, so I packed my boots and scanners and hopped on a plane.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Bullshittery isn’t a scientific term.”</p><p><p>Steven: <em>(shrugs)</em></p><p><p>“Ain’t got time for textbooks when the dream gods are flingin’ folks across space-time. I saw that map glow like a bass tracker sonar on meth. Whatever’s in that wood? It ain’t human.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“You understood the risks of harboring a possibly illegal extraterrestrial object?”</p><p><p>Steven: <em>(snorts)</em></p><p><p>“Buddy, I once duct-taped a live possum to a lightning rod just to measure atmospheric ion surges. You think I care about what the fuckin feds call ‘legal’?”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Did you experience any of these ‘dreams’?”</p><p><p>Steven: <em>(leans forward, dead serious)</em></p><p><p>“Not yet. But I ate a whole bag of Canadian trail mix and slept next to the damn thing for two nights. If I start foaming or speakin’ Latin backwards, I give you consent for exorcism.”</p><p><p>Agent: <em>(rubbing temples)</em></p><p><p>“What’s your formal academic training?”</p><p><p>Steven: <em>(grinning)</em></p><p><p>“Florida Institute of Computer Automation. Class of 2504. CS Bachelors degree. Valedictorian, technically. Long story.”</p><p><p><strong>Yuyan Chan - The Honorable Engineer</strong><p>Yuyan sat with his legs crossed, hands still cuffed. He gave a small nod as the agent entered ; polite, but unimpressed.</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Dr. Chan. You were part of the first manned rover-linked observation team on Nhexus?”</p><p><p>Yuyan: (nodding slowly)</p><p><p>“I was in the first remote-pilot module. We mapped the riverbeds and sediment layers around the southern equator trench. That’s where we found the fossilized structures.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“The structures your team claimed were artificial?”</p><p><p>Yuyan:</p><p><p>“I didn’t ‘claim.’ I presented photos, density scans, and magnetic field aberrations. You buried the report under six years of NDA glue.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“You were also the one who reported… a ‘presence’ near the obsidian fault?”</p><p><p>Yuyan: (pauses ; thoughtful)</p><p><p>“Yeah. Felt like something was watching through the cameras. Back then I thought it was stress. But I saw it again. At the ranch, we got evidence, I can show you.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“What exactly did you see?”</p><p><p>Yuyan: (leaning forward just slightly)</p><p><p>“It had a face like a pig. But it wasn't a pig. It felt… wrong. Like light bent around it.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“And you still agreed to travel across the country with the fugitives?”</p><p><p>Yuyan: (softly, in Mandarin)</p><p><p>“如果你看见真理了，就不能假装没看见。”</p><p><p><em>(“If you’ve seen the truth, you can’t pretend you haven’t.”)</em><p><strong>Dallas Red — Civilian, Ranch Owner, “Unauthorized Harboring of Federal Fugitives”</strong><p>Dallas sat hunched, one arm cradling his side. The agents hadn’t offered him water. Or ice. Just fluorescent lights and questions. His right eye was swollen, his left cheek stained with dried blood. Still, he sat with his hat on the table… not in surrender, just out of stubborn respect.</p><p><p>Two agents entered. No insignia.</p><p><p>Agent 1:</p><p><p>“You’ve got a long record of unconventional behavior, Mr. Red.”</p><p><p>Dallas: (groaning slightly)</p><p><p>“You got a badge or a name, or am I just talkin’ to ghosts now?”</p><p><p>Agent 2: (ignores him)</p><p><p>“You housed at least a dozen individuals on your property during the early invasion hysteria of 2532. Families. Tech workers. Alleged ‘refugees.’ You positioned it as a sanctuary.”</p><p><p>Dallas: (spits blood off his lip)</p><p><p>“They weren’t ‘alleged’ nothin’. Their homes were dangerous due to all the riots back then. I gave ‘em food, a roof, and quiet. The government gave ‘em warnings and curfews.”</p><p><p>Agent 1:</p><p><p>“And the truck?”</p><p><p>Dallas: (blinks through the concussion, eyes drifting)</p><p><p>“Showed up in my driveway. With plates. Keys in the seat. It’s insured to a guy who owns half of California. Figured it wasn’t mine, but it sure as hell wasn’t stolen.”</p><p><p>Agent 2:</p><p><p>“James Bethoz reported it missing three years ago.”</p><p><p>Dallas:</p><p><p>“Then maybe ask him about the interstellar entity that dropped it off with a damn glowing guitar.”</p><p><p>Agent 1:</p><p><p>“That guitar is a protected anomaly now. You claim it appeared after the alien contact?”</p><p><p>Dallas: (leaning back with a slow wince)</p><p><p>“No. The alien waltzed into my barn, handed me a guitar and asked me for a shot of whiskey.”</p><p><p>Agent 2: (stepping closer)</p><p><p>“Are you saying you’ve had direct contact with an Oc’Xari emissary?”</p><p><p>Dallas: (still holding his ribs, eyes glazed)</p><p><p>“I didn’t say that. But if you happen to interact with one… Tell it I need new hinges and a front door… since SOMEBODY kicked it open…”</p><p><p>Agent 1:</p><p><p>“Why’d you hide the guitar?”</p><p><p>Dallas:</p><p><p>“Because I have no idea what it’s capable of.”</p><p><p>Agent 2:</p><p><p>“What do you know about it?”</p><p><p>Dallas:</p><p><p>“It sounds great, has some map on it, and some technology… we’re trying to figure it out… and we could use your help.”</p><p><p>A long silence followed. One of the agents scribbled notes.</p><p><p>“Bastards cracked my rib and …trying to say I’m a kidnapper?! What the Hell…”</p><p><p>Agent 1:</p><p><p>“How did you meet former Commander Haoyu Zhang?”</p><p><p>Dallas smirked, eyes still puffy and blood-crusted.</p><p><p>Dallas:</p><p><p>“In a dream.”</p><p><p><em>(beat)</em><p>“It’s like the aliens connected us in dream world… a Saloon in the middle of nowhere. Aliens line dancing. Six-legged donkey playin’ with kids. Real spiritual stuff.”</p><p><p>The agents didn’t blink.</p><p><p>Agent 2:</p><p><p>“You’re not taking this seriously.”</p><p><p>Dallas: (shrugging slightly)</p><p><p>“Oh, I am. That’s actually how we met. Showed up four or five times. Then one day he’s just... standing in the café. In real life.”</p><p><p><em>(grinning faintly)</em><p>“Either I’m nuts, he’s nuts, or we both caught the same fever dream from somethin’ off-planet.”</p><p><p>Agent 1:</p><p><p>“So your story is... he appeared to you in a dream.”</p><p><p>Dallas: (dryly)</p><p><p>“Yup. But don’t worry ; I got a concussion, not brain damage. I know how it sounds. You already got my fingerprints and blood on file. Might as well add my dreams while you’re at it.”</p><p><p><h3><strong>Interrogation: Haoyu’s Wife - Civilian, Mother of Two</strong></h3><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Ma’am, were you aware your husband was skipping his court date?”</p><p><p>Wife: <em>(tired, composed)</em></p><p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Did he ever show signs of instability?”</p><p><p>Wife: <em>(glances sideways)</em></p><p><p>“He was a dedicated government employee! He worked 20 hard years for you! You have no appreciation for his hard work and dedication!”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Why did you follow him here?”</p><p><p>Wife: <em>(quietly)</em></p><p><p>“Because for the first time in years... he actually came home from work. And we were together.”</p><p><p><h3><strong>Interrogation: Haoyu’s Children</strong></h3><p>Agent: <em>(kneeling)</em></p><p><p>“Hey there, can I ask you something? Did Daddy talk about aliens?”</p><p><p>Daughter:</p><p><p>“Nuh-uh. He just helped us with homework and played Lego with us.”</p><p><p>Agent:</p><p><p>“Do you know what your daddys job is?”</p><p><p>Son : <em>(clutching his dino toy)</em></p><p><p>He mumbled, fearfully - in truth “He’s a Hero”</p><p><p><h3>Legal Outcomes – 2540</h3><p>By the time the international tribunal closed the books on what media branded <em>“The Saskatchewan Cult Incident,”</em> the lives of everyone involved had been shattered beyond recognition.</p><p><p><h3><strong>Pragnya Reddy</strong> and Yuyan <strong>Chan</strong></h3><p>Both were deported back to the United States within 48 hours of questioning. Their responses had been polite, composed, and minimally incriminating ; but insufficient to escape scrutiny.</p><p><p>They were issued felony charges under U.S. Code 18 § 2332f for <em>“providing technical assistance in unauthorized cross-border paramilitary infrastructure with potential extraterrestrial conspiracy.”</em></p><p><p>Though the charges were inflated and paper-thin, they stuck.</p><p><p>Both were placed under probationary supervision, assigned digital parole officers, and barred from working in any scientific field for a minimum of 10 years.</p><p><p>They left Canada with bruised reputations ; and a smoldering resentment towards Haoyu, Dmitry and Steven, whose bombastic interrogations had only made things worse for the team.</p><p><p><h3><strong>Steven Young</strong> and Dmitry Alexeyev</h3><p>The Canadian court deemed them “aggressively non-compliant” and classified their behavior as "technologically subversive with potential for retaliatory communication leaks.”</p><p><p>Their charges included:</p><p><p><ul>
<li><strong>Unlicensed signal broadcasting</strong></li>
<li><strong>Refusal to comply with subnational authority</strong></li>
<li><strong>Suspected hoax perpetration with intent to incite unrest</strong></li>
<li><strong>Conspiracy to breach aerospace radio silence codes</strong></li>
</ul><p>They were quietly transferred to a low-security facility in Georgia, where they would serve close to 3 years in prison, mostly to keep them quiet and contained.</p><p><p>Their pleas for appeal were ignored.</p><p><p><h3><strong>The Children</strong></h3><p>Removed immediately from their mother’s custody during the raid, the two minors were flown under sealed identity to a state-run youth containment center in Sacramento, California.</p><p><p>Though no charges were filed against them, the official report cited “emergency protection due to exposure to psychologically destabilizing environments and cult-like activity.”</p><p><p>They were renamed in the system and barred from any contact with either parent until age 18.</p><p><p><h3><strong>The Wife</strong></h3><p>She was placed under an emergency psychiatric hold in a Manhattan facility, initially for “post-traumatic disassociation” and later reclassified under Section 12.7 for <em>“paranoid delusion and alien-induced psychosis.”</em></p><p><p>Despite a clean mental health history, the decision was non-negotiable.</p><p><p>Her screams when they took the kids echoed in the hallway until the padded door closed.</p><p><p><h3><strong>Dallas Red</strong></h3><p>The court declared him an extreme threat to civil society.</p><p><p>The charges included:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>Theft of a historic private asset valued at $11.7 million (the 1950 Ford F1)</li>
<li>Criminal asylum and kidnapping of 17 displaced families during global emergency</li>
<li>Aiding and abetting a fugitive war criminal (Haoyu)</li>
<li>Possession and concealment of high-risk alien artifacts</li>
</ul><p>They did not care about the dreams.</p><p><p>They did not care that the guitar had no discernible military function.</p><p><p>They didn’t care that he actually helped the families- they just had a narrative to fulfill.</p><p><p>He was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole in Canada’s Dollard Maximum Security Facility.</p><p><p>His only words during sentencing:</p><p><p>“This is fucking bullshit.”</p><p><p><h3><strong>Commander Haoyu Zhang</strong></h3><p>Once the face of <em>Echofall</em>, now branded the architect of mass manipulation and the root cause behind World War 5 - essentially being labeled as Adolf Hitler of the 26th century.</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2023%20-%20The%20Donkey/480489657_122227173242031351_3584177813071223863_n.jpg" alt="480489657_122227173242031351_3584177813071223863_n.jpg" class="content-image"><p><All blame, responsibility and accountability of all wrong doings of the world since the the Oc’Xari invasion was put onto the Commander - the scapegoat - the savior of Earths sins.><p>His sentence:</p><p><p><ul>

<li>Followed by state-executed termination</li>
<li>Shipped out and locked up in a windowless, 5 x 4 foot steel containment cell beneath Angola Supermax Facility in Louisiana</li>

<li>Orchestrating an international disinformation network</li>
<li>Defying a court-mandated appearance</li>
<li>Evading prison sentence</li>
<li>Smuggling foreign nationals and prohibited technology</li>
<li>The kidnapping of his wife, kids, and his fellow crew</li>
<li>Unlawful reactivation of Level-3 banned extraterrestrial telemetry systems</li>
