                <h1>Chapter 20 - The Saloon</h1><h3>I. The Arrival at the Chuckwagon Café</h3><p>Haoyu pulled into the gravel lot at 3:37 PM.</p><p><p>About half an hour early.</p><p><p>His tires crunched to a stop in a familiar place that ; technically ; he had never been to. The sky above was bright and windless, the kind of dry Alberta calm that made sound carry a little too far. The Chuckwagon Café stood just ahead, nestled at the edge of the prairies, looking perfectly ordinary.</p><p><p>Too ordinary.</p><p><p>He cut the engine, sat still for a moment, and just… stared.</p><p><p>This was the fourth time he’d seen the saloon.</p><p><p>But this time?</p><p><p>It wasn’t a dream.</p><p><p>He pinched the inside of his forearm ; hard.</p><p><p>It stung… Had to make sure it wasn’t a dream this time.</p><p><p>His mind reeled back through every appearance:</p><p><p><ul>
<li>The first time, he was sitting at the bar beside Dallas and the Oc’Xari, sharing moonshine. The boots. The line dancing. The laughter.</li>
<li>The second time, in the crystallized wastelands, where he’d entered first... and Dallas vanished. The inside had twisted with alien eeriness. Wrong angles. No Dallas. Unsettling atmosphere.</li>
<li>The third time, in the horrific waking vision of Nhexus, where the saloon led into a pulsing swamp of suffering; grotesque creatures shrieking from the walls, a pus pit in the center of the room, and that pig-beast in the back, staring, and the wailing howls of the mega pyramid</li>
</ul><p>Now?</p><p><p>Now it was just… there.</p><p><p>Quiet. Plain. Wooden siding faded from sun, red-painted door, hanging “OPEN” sign gently swaying.</p><p><p>He sat in the car, engine off, and thought:</p><p><p>“Wait a second… I’ve never even BEEN here before.”</p><p><p>He blinked.</p><p><p>“I don’t know this town. I don’t know this café. I’ve never met Dallas in real life… I don’t even know if Dallas is REAL.”</p><p><p>He gripped the steering wheel a little tighter.</p><p><p>“Am I losing it? Was this all just some mass hallucination? Why am I here?”</p><p><p>But then; like a man finishing an argument with himself ; he let go of the questions.</p><p><p>There were no answers in the car.</p><p><p>So he stepped out, shoes meeting gravel with that satisfying crunch, and walked slowly toward the door.</p><p><p>The Chuckwagon Café stood peaceful in the late-afternoon light.</p><p><p>He reached for the handle</p><p><p>Paused, let out a sigh</p><p><p>Then pushed it open.</p><p><p>A soft jingle of the bell above the door rang out.</p><p><p>No shrieking beasts. No moonshine aliens. No crystalline valleys.</p><p><p>Just a perfectly normal, western-style café in some random small country town.</p><p><p>Booths in soft red leather. Worn wooden floors. Walls adorned with cowboy hats and bullhorns. A soft country song playing from unseen speakers.</p><p><p>And standing there by the host stand, wearing an apron and a big, warm smile, was a young woman with a notepad.</p><p><p>She beamed at him.</p><p><p>“Hey there! Welcome in! How’s your day going?”</p><p><p>Haoyu just blinked.</p><p><p>A beat of silence.</p><p><p>Then:</p><p><p>“...Uhh… Good.”</p><p><p>The young woman tilted her head, smile softening just a touch.</p><p><p>“That wasn’t a very reassuring ‘good.’”</p><p><p>“Well, I hope our food and drinks can cheer you up.”</p><p><p>She glanced at the tablet in her hand, then looked back up at him.</p><p><p>“Is the table just for you today, or...?”</p><p><p>Haoyu hesitated, eyes flicking toward the door.</p><p><p>“...I’m expecting a guest.”</p><p><p>“Not sure if he’ll show up, but... he’s supposed to arrive at four.”</p><p><p>She nodded with gentle professionalism.</p><p><p>“No worries at all. I’ll seat you right by the window so you can see the parking lot and folks coming in.”</p><p><p>“Take your time with the order. I can bring you a coffee while you wait.”</p><p><p>“Sure,” Haoyu said, with a small grateful nod. “Black, please.”</p><p><p><img src="images/Chapter%2020%20-%20The%20Saloon/ChatGPT_Image_May_12_2025_11_34_36_AM.png" alt="ChatGPT Image May 12, 2025, 11_34_36 AM.png" class="content-image"><p>She led him to a booth nestled by the front window. The sun filtered through the dusty glass, casting lazy shadows over the tabletop ; real, solid, warm.</p><p><p>Haoyu slid into the booth slowly.</p><p><p>Sat back.</p><p><p>Exhaled.</p><p><p>He looked out the window at the gravel lot where his car was still parked. A pickup truck pulled in, someone with a cowboy hat got out… not Dallas, and walked inside without a glance.</p><p><p>Haoyu looked down at the smooth menu.</p><p><p>The napkin dispenser.</p><p><p>The sugar packets in their little holder.</p><p><p>The warmth of the ceramic mug when the server brought his coffee.</p><p><p>All of it grounded.</p><p><p>All of it real.</p><p><p>He finally collected himself.</p><p><p>And with a slow breath, he thought:</p><p><p>“This isn’t a dream.”</p><p><p><em>“This is actually happening.”</em><p><em>“I’m in a café in a town I never knew existed… waiting for a man I’ve only ever met in dreams.”</em><p>He picked up the coffee.</p><p><p>Took a sip.</p><p><p>Looked at the door.</p><p><p>And waited.</p><p><p>It was 4:25.</p><p><p>Haoyu’s eyes flicked down to his watch again, then to the clock on the wall, then back to his phone screen.</p><p><p>Still the same numbers.</p><p><p>He exhaled through his nose ; barely audible, but tight.</p><p><p>The coffee was long gone.</p><p><p>Two glasses of water, drained.</p><p><p>He’d adjusted the sugar packets into a perfect row and then ruined the arrangement just to do something with his hands.</p><p><p>The waitress had checked on him twice ; once at 4:05, again at 4:18. The second time, she gave a sympathetic smile and asked if he was sure his guest was still coming.</p><p><p>He had nodded politely.</p><p><p>Now his knee bounced beneath the table.</p><p><p>His eyes darted to the door as it opened…</p><p><p>Not Dallas… Just some other random cowboy.</p><p><p>A man in overalls had walked in earlier. A group of teens had shuffled past, laughing over milkshakes. But no Dallas.</p><p><p>“How long should I wait?”</p><p><p><em>“Where is he?”</em><p><em>“Was he real?”</em><p><em>“Was any of this real?”</em><p>He rubbed his temples, elbows on the table, trying to steady his breathing.</p><p><p>“Jesus Christ…”</p><p><p><em>“How did I just… get up and go to fucking Alberta in the middle of my court trial dates…”</em><p><em>“And just expect to find a cowboy from a dream?”</em><p>His reflection in the window caught him off guard. He looked tired. Out of place. Almost foolish.</p><p><p>“What the hell am I doing here?”</p><p><p>His phone buzzed once.</p><p><p>It wasn’t a message.</p><p><p>Just the weather update.</p><p><p>Cloudy skies, mild winds, 16°C.</p><p><p>No signs. No omens.</p><p><p>Just the weight of waiting.</p><p><p>And doubt.</p><p><p>4:41 PM.</p><p><p>Haoyu glanced at his watch one last time, let out a quiet sigh through his nose, and slowly stood up.</p><p><p>He went to use the restroom after drinking all that water and coffee.</p><p><p>As he finished up, he came back out, and the waitress smiled with excitement and exclaimed “your friend arrived!”</p><p><p>Haoyu almost in shock, had to rub his eyes, glanced at the table he was just sitting at… and low and behold… There sat an old grizzled cowboy. It was Dallas.</p><p><p>There wasn’t no alien, there wasn’t any moonshine - hell, this place wasn’t even a bar… it was just a cafe, that sold coffee, burgers and pies… it was a lot different than all the crazy dreams.</p><p><p><h3>II. The First Real Conversation</h3><p>Haoyu approached the table slowly. His boots felt heavier than before. His pulse ; somehow calm and racing at once.</p><p><p>Dallas looked up from the laminated menu with a wry grin, cowboy hat tilted back just enough to show the lines carved deep into his sun-worn face.</p><p><p>“Well I’ll be damned,” Dallas said, his voice low and dusted with that familiar prairie drawl.</p><p><p>“It <em>is</em> you.”</p><p><p>Haoyu stopped beside the booth. Still standing.</p><p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p><p>“You know me?”</p><p><p>Dallas chuckled ; just once ; and set the menu down.</p><p><p>“Whole damn world knows you, Commander Zhang.”</p><p><p>“You’re all over the feeds. Courtroom footage. Leaked recordings. Alien rover broadcasts.”</p><p><p>“Hell, I saw your face on the <em>Weather Channel</em> last week.”</p><p><p>He motioned to the seat across from him.</p><p><p>“Sit. Coffee’s hotter than a tractor hood in July.”</p><p><p>Haoyu didn’t sit. Not yet.</p><p><p>“You’re Dallas.”</p><p><p>“Yup.”</p><p><p>“How are you real?”</p><p><p>Dallas didn’t answer right away. He scratched his jaw, then took a slow sip of his own coffee ; black, just like Haoyu’s.</p><p><p>“That’s a hell of a question.”</p><p><p>“I got an even crazier question for you; How many times have you been at this Cafe now?</p><p><p>Haoyu blinked.</p><p><p>“...Yeah. Four times now. The first was fun. The second got weird. The third was straight-up terrifying, and the fourth time… is right now.”</p><p><p>“Right? That second one,” Dallas nodded, “I walked in... and you were gone.”</p><p><p>Haoyu turned to him sharply.</p><p><p>“Exactly. I was alone. My court trial was playing on the TV and the aliens were watching.”</p><p><p>Dallas looked over, raising an eyebrow.</p><p><p>“That’s so weird, ‘cause in my dream, it was the same thing, except you were the one who vanished. I remember walkin’ through that crystal valley and opening the door to the saloon. And you never came inside, I looked out the window to check for you, but you were gone. I was there alone with a dozen Watchers watchin’ footage of your trial.”</p><p><p>They both sat with that - goosebumps rose on both their arms.</p><p><p>Two dreams. Opposite ends of the same memory.</p><p><p>“I can’t believe we are both here, talking about this” Haoyu said softly</p><p><p>“Yeah, I wasn’t totally sure you’d even be here.” Dallas replied. “Ain’t that a head-kicker.”</p><p><p>Haoyu hesitated for a second, then said quietly:</p><p><p>“Did you ever see... a pig-like thing? In one of the dreams? Inside the saloon, when it turned into; Nhexus?”</p><p><p>Dallas’s jaw tensed. His hands tightened slightly on the wheel.</p><p><p>“Yeah,” he said. “I saw it. Big bastard. Didn’t move much, but... it was wrong. Just sittin’ there... staring into my soul, like it knew somethin’.”</p><p><p>Haoyu nodded slowly, his face pale.</p><p><p>“It glared at me. Like it was angry we were there. Like we weren’t supposed to see it.”</p><p><p>Dallas muttered, eyes on the road.</p><p><p>“I don’t get spooked easy. But that thing... it wasn’t just ugly. It was evil. That’s the word. Don’t like us pokin’ around that part of the story.”</p><p><p>They were both quiet for a long moment.</p><p><p>Then, as if by mutual unspoken agreement, they steered the conversation elsewhere.</p><p><p>Haoyu leaned forward.</p><p><p>“So, we’ve never met each other, and I’ve never even been to Canada, why are we here?”</p><p><p>“Why Alberta? Why this café? Why did we dream of this place?”</p><p><p>Dallas lowered his gaze for a moment, rubbing his knuckles along the table’s edge.</p><p><p>“That part’s been botherin’ me too, I never even knew about this town, let alone the cafe.”</p><p><p>“But I’ll tell you this much ; the Oc’Xari are watching our every move, and listening to every word we say. When they were in the Saloon watching you on TV, it became clear to me that for some reason you and me are the center of the stage for their entire planet..”</p><p><p>Dallas glanced around the Chuckwagon Café, eyes scanning the quaint wooden decor, the soft country music, the dessert board scrawled with chalk.</p><p><p>He leaned back a little and muttered:</p><p><p>“Y’know... kinda funny thing.”</p><p><p>“There ain’t even a bar in this place.”</p><p><p>Haoyu was thinking of that earlier as well</p><p><p>“Yeah,” he said slowly. “I noticed that too.”</p><p><p>“No booze, no stools, no shelves with weird whiskey labels. Just... tables. Pie. All day breakfast. Cafe Style Sandwiches. And decaf.”</p><p><p>He looked toward the back of the café, where a humble soda fountain stood next to a glass case of lemon meringue slices.</p><p><p>“This place closes at five,” Haoyu added - as he looks at the time again reading at 4:57pm</p><p><p>“The sign on the door says ‘Closed Sundays. No Loitering.’ I asked the waitress earlier ; they don’t even do evening service.”</p><p><p>“They <em>definitely</em> don’t host cowboy dance parties with aliens.”</p><p><p>Dallas gave a dry chuckle and shook his head.</p><p><p>“Then where the hell did all that happen?”</p><p><p>“The boots. The guitar. That Oc’Xari fella singin’ that damned song...”</p><p><p>Haoyu said nothing.</p><p><p>He was staring out the window again, watching the slow drift of a pickup truck down the gravel road, stirring up dust that never quite settled.</p><p><p>“We saw the same place,” he said finally.</p><p><p>“But it wasn’t <em>this</em> place. It was <em>wearing</em> this place. Same shell. Different rules.”</p><p><p>“Like the Oc’Xari were trying to get us comfortable. Give us something familiar... before peeling it apart.”</p><p><p>Dallas nodded slowly.</p><p><p>“You ever been to one of those cowboy reenactment towns, what is it… a Potemkin village?”</p><p><p>“Everything looks real from the outside. But behind the saloon doors it’s just plywood and rope lights.”</p><p><p>He took another sip of coffee.</p><p><p>“What if we’re sittin’ in the plywood version now?”</p><p><p>Haoyu turned toward him.</p><p><p>“So then what ; you think we came here because they wanted us to?”</p><p><p>“Because they left us a trail? A place to reconnect the dots?”</p><p><p>Dallas set his mug down, eyes steady.</p><p><p>“No.”</p><p><p>“I think they wanted us to meet. And this was the only place on Earth where the dream and the waking world were close enough to <em>touch.</em>”</p><p><p>Haoyu frowned, mind racing.</p><p><p>“So... we’re like two tuning forks. Same note. Resonating from different ends of the galaxy.”</p><p><p>“And this café is like a weird gateway, or has some kind of special energy for them, the one place where the sound doesn’t cancel out.”</p><p><p>Dallas nodded slowly.</p><p><p>“That’s poetically put, Commander.”</p><p><p>“But yeah. Somethin’ like that.”</p><p><p>They both sat in silence again, each sipping their now lukewarm coffees, staring not at each other ; but at the strange, ordinary reality surrounding them.</p><p><p><h3>III. The Ol’ Brand New Truck</h3><p><img src="images/Chapter%2020%20-%20The%20Saloon/prairies.jpg" alt="prairies.jpg" class="content-image"><p>A small chime echoed from the kitchen.</p><p><p>The waitress appeared, now without the earlier sparkle of greeting ; her apron slightly rumpled, tablet tucked under one arm, tired smile on her lips.</p><p><p>“Just a heads up, fellas. We close in about a minute, but no rush ; take your time wrapping up.”</p><p><p>Dallas nodded, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a worn leather wallet. Haoyu instinctively did the same. A quiet shuffle of bills. Dallas tucked a modest tip under the edge of the empty pie plate and scribbled something on the receipt that might have been a thank-you or a doodle of a steer.</p><p><p>They stepped outside into the early sunset of prairie dusk.</p><p><p>The door swung shut behind them with a soft clunk. The gravel lot stretched quiet and empty, save for two parked vehicles ; Haoyu’s nondescript rental... and the other.</p><p><p>Haoyu froze mid-step.</p><p><p>The sky had dimmed just enough that the chrome trim gleamed faintly in the fading light. Red paint. Cream trim. Gleaming lines. Rounded fenders like shoulders hunched in thought.</p><p><p>A 1950 Ford F1 pickup.</p><p><p>Perfect condition.</p><p><p>Haoyu squinted, brow furrowing.</p><p><p>“I feel like I’ve seen this truck before.”</p><p><p>Dallas tilted his hat back and smirked.</p><p><p>“Yeah. Remember? You helped me pump gas into it.”</p><p><p>Haoyu blinked hard, eyes darting between the truck and Dallas.</p><p><p>“We’ve never met before...”</p><p><p>Dallas just smiled and started toward the truck.</p><p><p>“Yeah we have… You were standin’ next to me at that gas station just outside some crystallized alien planet version of Pincher Creek, pumping premium grade like you’ve done it a hundred times.”</p><p><p>Haoyu staggered for a half-step, mind reeling like static in a storm.</p><p><p>“I… no, that’s... that wasn’t real. That wasn’t... how could we both remember the same dream?”</p><p><p>Dallas chuckled, unlatching the tailgate to toss in his jacket.</p><p><p>“Welcome to the show, Commander.”</p><p><p>Haoyu stared at the truck, then back at Dallas.</p><p><p>“Alright. Seriously though... where did you get this thing? It’s over five hundred years old now. It looks brand new.”</p><p><p>Dallas shut the tailgate with a soft <em>clack</em>.</p><p><p>“That’s the weird part,” he said calmly. “It just showed up one morning. End of spring. I thought maybe some old rancher dumped it on my land. But when I checked the papers inside; insurance, registration, VIN plate and all; it’s registered to some guy named James Bethoz.”</p><p><p>Haoyu’s face went pale.</p><p><p>“James... Bethoz?”</p><p><p>Dallas nodded.</p><p><p>“Yup. Ring a bell?”</p><p><p>Haoyu rubbed his temples.</p><p><p>“He owns, like... half the tech industry in the United States. He’s ex-CEO of LunarNet, part owner of Equinox Drive, and last I heard, he’s trying to buy real estate on Titan.”</p><p><p>He looked back at the truck, alarm rising in his voice.</p><p><p>“Dallas… if that’s his truck... and it just appeared after an alien gave you some guitar artifact...”</p><p><p>He stepped back, staring at it now like it might explode.</p><p><p>“He’s definitely looking for it. Hell, the CIA might be looking for it. This whole parking lot could be under surveillance right now!”</p><p><p>Dallas chuckled again, slowly and dryly this time.</p><p><p>“I mean, could be. Or maybe... this truck didn’t just show up for no reason. Maybe it was meant to show up. Just like you were.”</p><p><p>He patted the hood once, like greeting an old friend.</p><p><p>“Come on. I’ll drive.”</p><p><p>Haoyu looked at the truck, then at Dallas.</p><p><p>Then he exhaled.</p><p><p>And got in.</p><p><p>As Haoyu settled into the worn passenger seat, the upholstered, quality leather cushioned softly beneath him. Dallas slid the key into the ignition, gave it a confident twist</p><p><p>WHUUMMP-k-k-k-KRRAAHHHT-WHAAAHM.</p><p><p>The Ford F1 roared awake, coughing and snarling like an old dragon pulling itself from a long slumber. The dashboard rattled faintly. The mirrors vibrated. The smell of faint oil and something <em>mechanical</em> filled the cab.</p><p><p>Haoyu instinctively flinched, gripping the handle on the door… in the 26th century, cars don’t make noises like that anymore, so it caught Haoyu off guard.</p><p><p>“What the hell was that?”</p><p><p>Dallas laughed, low and content.</p><p><p>“That, partner, is the sound of the 20th century.”</p><p><p>They pulled away from the gravel lot, the truck rumbling deep beneath them ; not the smooth electric whir Haoyu was used to, not the hum of grav-drive or mag-suspension. This was grit and fire, pistons and combustion, the ghost of an era long gone.</p><p><p>But even still…</p><p><p>Haoyu felt it.</p><p><p>The ride was smooth. Surreal, even.</p><p><p>The suspension was soft, steady. The seat molded around him like a memory. Everything <em>should</em> have clunked and rattled; but it didn’t. The truck moved like it remembered a time when the world was slower, and more certain.</p><p><p>They looped around the block once, tires whispering over old prairie asphalt, past quiet homes and yellowing grass fields. Then circled back into the café lot, pulling up beside Haoyu’s bland rental.</p><p><p>The engine idled like a distant drum.</p><p><p>Haoyu turned, still absorbing the strange comfort of the ride.</p><p><p>“So…” he said, finally, “you mentioned the guitar. With the map on it?”</p><p><p>He glanced at Dallas.</p><p><p>“Can I see it?”</p><p><p>Dallas shifted in his seat, leaning back and reaching for the door handle.</p><p><p>“C’mon. It’s in the back.”</p><p><p>They stepped out into the cooling prairie air. The truck’s engine ticked quietly as it settled from the short drive. Dallas walked to the back and untied the rope that fastened a lumpy tarp over the truck bed. With a practiced flick, he pulled it aside to reveal an old, beaten-down guitar case ; the kind that looked like it had been on a thousand barroom stages.</p><p><p>He popped the latches.</p><p><p>Inside, nestled in worn velvet, was the guitar.</p><p><p>It shimmered faintly.</p><p><p>Not with paint or polish ; but with something <em>beneath</em> the surface. Its dark wood held faint starlight patterns, glowing just enough to be seen, as if the constellations themselves were embedded inside the grain. Strings of unfamiliar alloy. The pickguard etched in geometric spirals.</p><p><p>Haoyu leaned in slowly.</p><p><p>Brows furrowed.</p><p><p>“This… this is beautiful, but I have no idea what I’m looking at.”</p><p><p>He ran a hand just above the surface ; not touching it ; the way one might regard a dangerous relic.</p><p><p>“It’s like a map… but the coordinates don’t align with anything I know. Too many dimensions. Too many intersections.”</p><p><p>Dallas scratched the back of his head.</p><p><p>“I figured it was some kind of starmap. I tried lining it up with the Big Dipper and Orion and all that but… nothin’ makes sense.”</p><p><p>Haoyu exhaled.</p><p><p>“Yeah. It’s… beyond me.”</p><p><p>He stared a moment longer, then stepped back, his mind already racing.</p><p><p>“But it wouldn’t be beyond my team.”</p><p><p>Dallas raised a brow.</p><p><p>“Your what-now?”</p><p><p>Haoyu turned, speaking quickly now.</p><p><p>“My team. From Echofall. We had a crew of twenty-two ; astrophysicists, biologists, systems engineers, planetary geologists, linguistic AI analysts, the works. We built the interstellar telemetry for the Nhexus probe and drove it around the surface of the planet before it all got shut down. Most of them are unemployed now. Blacklisted or burned out.”</p><p><p>Dallas watched him closely.</p><p><p>“You want to bring them here?”</p><p><p>“Yes. I can call all 22 of them and see who has the time, money and effort to come out.”</p><p><p>He hesitated, then added, a little sheepishly:</p><p><p>“We’d need a place to work. I know it’s a lot to ask on our first date, but… think we could hole up in your barn for a while?”</p><p><p>Dallas raised an amused brow at that.</p><p><p>Haoyu pressed on.</p><p><p>“I mean it. This guitar could hold answers to the biggest question humanity’s ever asked. I spent twenty years on the Echofall project, and when the panic started, they buried us. The whole damn thing. But now…”</p><p><p>He gestured to the guitar, voice quieter.</p><p><p>“Now the aliens gave us something. A message. Maybe a map. And I’ll be honest… I’m supposed to be back in court in two days. I’m probably going to prison for at least a decade. But it almost seems like the aliens chose us to figure out this map, that’s never happened before in human history…”</p><p><p>A silence settled between them.</p><p><p>Dallas looked down at the guitar.</p><p><p>Then nodded.</p><p><p>“Alright. We’ll set up shop in the barn. Plenty of space. Power too. Might need to chase the raccoons out first, but you’ll manage.”</p><p><p>“And the crew?”</p><p><p>“Yeah. Call your crew, hell… call your wife and kids too, bring them all. I’ll head into Calgary with you, we’ll drop off your rental, grab a hotel downtown, and I’ll stash the truck in the underground garage. You can meet your folks there. We’ll head back down to the ranch in the morning.”</p><p><p>Haoyu exhaled, the weight of months lifting from his shoulders.</p><p><p>“Thank you. Seriously.”</p><p><p>Dallas shrugged.</p><p><p>“Don’t thank me yet. Just don’t let your alien map blow a hole through my barn.”</p><p><p>By 6:05 PM, they had made it to Calgary. Haoyu and Dallas pulled their vehicles into the underground garage of a modest hotel near the river. Haoyu was on his phone calling all 22 members of his crew, including his wife on the road to Calgary. Out of the 22 crew, only the four crew members responded as available; Dr. Pragnya Reddy (bio-interface signal analysis), Yuyan Chan (planetary geologist and astrophysicist),  Steven Young (Cloud Infrastructure and Telecommunications Engineer), and fourth, Dmitry Alexeyev, (the Lead Systems Engineer from Echofall), along with Haoyu’s wife and kids would land early the next morning..</p><p><p>Tomorrow, the real work would begin.
Dallas and Haoyu went to sleep without much conversation, and thankfully- no dreams that night.</p><p>
