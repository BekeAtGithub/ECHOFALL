### **The Origin of LUCA Evolution**

A long time ago, in a planet far far away… there was an intelligent alien civilization living in a distant solar system. 

“The Ancient Ones” were highly advanced in biology, physics, and engineering. However, they could never advance enough in technology to travel beyond their own solar system, they were sort of on an island far away from other habitable star systems.

Over time, they used up all the natural resources. They mined and farmed all of their planets and moons which led to culture shifts where progression and innovation slowed, and they switched to long term survival mentality rather than growth and abundance mentality.

After a long time, their home star neared the end of its life. It grew unstable, and the entire system was becoming uninhabitable. The civilization realized that they were at the brink of extinction. They ran out of time.

They had many ideas, plans and strategies, however the resistance was futile, and they just couldn’t make anything work. Thinking they were completely alone in the universe, they focused on one final project: to make sure life would continue to exist, even if they were gone.

They created a biological seed. It was not a living organism, but a very simple, adaptable form of organic material; a starting point for life. They called it LUCA: Last Universal Common Ancestor.

They powered up their planetary factories to produce trillions of LUCA seeds. These seeds were designed to survive in space and potentially begin the chain reaction process of evolution on other planets.

Then, using all remaining resources, they built a massive cannon. It was built to launch the LUCA seeds into space in a spread shot manner like a shotgun shooting ducks out of the sky in Louisiana; the seed was planted across the galaxy.

Majority of the seeds did not survive.

- Most drifted through space forever, never landing.
- Some were destroyed by stars, black holes, or radiation.
- Some landed on planets that were too dangerous or unstable.

But out of the trillions they launched, approx 1,000-1,500 LUCA seeds landed on planets that could support life.

However, life is fragile.

Out of these planets, majority ****experienced early extinction events; massive disasters like asteroid impacts, plagues, super volcanoes, extreme weather, or solar flares. Life either never fully developed or was completely wiped out.

We currently know of a few noteworthy planets which succeeded.

On these few planets, the LUCA seed survived, evolved, and over millions of years, gave rise to completely new ecosystems and intelligent species. 

The alien civilization that launched the seeds did not live to see what happened. They faded into extinction within thirty thousand years after the launch.

But their final act gave rise to entirely new forms of life across the galaxy; including humans.

# The Chronicles of Evolution

*An Unofficial Cultural and Evolutionary Record of LUCA-Origin Worlds*

Compiled 102.3 Billion Years Post-Seeding

---

Disclaimer:


As you begin this book, keep one truth in mind:

Not all of the species you are about to encounter are truly *alien*.

They were not born of separate origins.

They, like you, were shaped from the same ancient seed ; LUCA.

These are your distant cousins.

Forgotten branches on the same tree.

And though their worlds were strange, their struggle was not.

What you’re about to read is not just history.

It’s ancestry.

These stories aren’t just about them.

It’s about us.

"With over a thousand LUCA-seeded planets where life bloomed and eventually died, there is simply too much to record in one volume.

Amongst the historical council of intergalactic librarians, we’ve voted and agreed to include just a few of the most bizarre, meaningful, heroic, and beloved worlds to highlight in this historical book.

Some burned brightly before their end. Others never had a chance. But all are worth remembering."

# Chapter 1 - A Frozen Generation

I hope you brought a winter jacket; this place is freezing cold…

---

## **Trenmor-3 -The Frozen Generation**

“Trenmor-3 was cold, and it sucked. Like Mongolia… no, maybe not that bad.
Most seeds landed on planets that weren’t very optimal for life. Trenmor-3 was the most common scenario.”

---

### I. Planet Overview

- **Size:** 0.93 Earth radius
- **Gravity:** 0.91G
- **Atmosphere:** Almost none ; trace methane, sulfur vapor near fissures
- **Surface:** Global crust of permafrost and frozen stone
- **Water:** Trapped beneath thick ice sheets; superheated by geothermal vents
- **Geology:** Extremely thin crust, riddled with rift valleys and deep oceanic faultlines

Trenmor-3 was a planet of silence, frost and isolation. Life thrived deep below, where the crust cracked open and ribbon oceans of boiling black water surged around volcanic chimneys.

![berth54_Huge_glacier_breaking_up_into_icebergs_arctic_landscape_07e8c23d-9afa-4138-a855-708614cd3bab.png](Chapter%201%20-%20A%20Frozen%20Generation/berth54_Huge_glacier_breaking_up_into_icebergs_arctic_landscape_07e8c23d-9afa-4138-a855-708614cd3bab.png)

<Nitrogen lakes of Trenmore-3>

---

### II. Evolutionary Landscape

LUCA’s earliest descendants were extremophiles ; heat-loving microbial life that formed long, sticky mats across geothermal cliffs and cave walls.

These microbes:

- Evolved sheathed membranes for surviving pressure and temperature spikes
- Organized into biofilms with internal logic, distributing nutrients across colonies
- Began forming spiral growth structures, curling in on themselves in Fibonacci-like patterns for efficient space usage

As oxygen was nearly nonexistent, most life on Trenmor-3 used chemosynthesis, pulling energy from sulfides, iron, and basalt crust.

Over hundreds of millions of years, life grew more complex ; but not *larger*.

Instead, it became more organized, like biological architecture.

---

### III. The Age of Pattern

By ~780 million years post-LUCA, microbial colonies across Trenmor’s deep ocean began behaving increasingly structured.

Colonies exhibited:

- Geometric nesting: circular or hexagonal grid formation, likely for thermal balance
- Memory-linked reproduction: cells would delay division based on past environmental signals
- Signal coordination: entire cliff walls pulsed in bioluminescent waves based on geothermal cycles

Researchers now believe these colonies achieved a form of distributed proto-consciousness ; not thought as we know it, but memory encoded in the rhythm of division and death.

Life lived on this way for millions of years. Never really flourishing, just surviving in tiny heat pockets throughout the planet.

[Chapter 2 - Slop Life](Chapter%202%20-%20Slop%20Life%201e7fda674d69805a8a3df37dacfd46a1.md)

---

# Chapter 2 - Slop Life

As we started Chapter 1 with a familiar, easy going, pleasant world of many similarities, let’s take a 180 turn. This is a world where evolution failed *constantly*. 

If you have a weak stomach - perhaps, skip this chapter.

This story is heinous, putrid and slow.

---

"Most LUCA-seeded planets died because life was too slow, too fragile, or too bold.
On Nhexus however, life flourished… but it shouldn’t have. 
The seed was damaged, and there was probably something wrong with the planet, too."

## **Nhexus - The Slop Planet**

---

### I. Planet Overview

- **Size:** 1.05 Earth radius
- **Gravity:** 0.96G
- **Atmosphere:** Ammonia-thick, caustic vapor pockets, acidic rainfall
- **Temperature:** Moderate but chemically unstable
- **Surface:** Soft, spongey terrain; prone to organic rot crusts
- **Oceans:** Shallow toxic brine seas laced with dissolved proteins and alcohols

Nhexus began like many LUCA worlds ; fertile, warm, chemically diverse.

But at the molecular level, life was already unclean.

![arsheapriestess_57403_numenera_style_chaotic_alien_landscape_wi_69b46e73-6acb-474a-9d90-f7081cfea4a1.png](Chapter%202%20-%20Slop%20Life/arsheapriestess_57403_numenera_style_chaotic_alien_landscape_wi_69b46e73-6acb-474a-9d90-f7081cfea4a1.png)

<Early landscapes of Nhexus>

---

### II. The Age of Slop

### ~100–800 million years post-LUCA

This LUCA Seed must have been flawed in production… or perhaps tainted during it’s trip to Nhexus.

Early life crawled from mucosal brine pits and formed squirming blankets across swamp-crusts littered with all types of insects.

These organisms lacked structure. They often:

- Vomited excess proteins their cells couldn’t fold correctly
- Grew half-formed limbs that detached and rotted
- Developed reversible nervous systems, causing pain when touched or thinking

Many had no rear end, so waste was expelled from skin pores or from their faces, creating trails of pus, blood, excrement and other bodily fluids - some of those fluids would result in unintentional reproduction.

Those that grew larger:

- Developed skull-walls that never closed, leaving brains partially exposed, being vulnerable to all sorts of parasites, diseases and plagues
- Grew eyes on inward-facing stalks, forcing vision into themselves
- Used tongues to walk, dragging themselves by taste muscle

Each lineage became only more ridden with evolutionary failures.

![480913718_122228762360031351_3887249303421508005_n.jpg](Chapter%202%20-%20Slop%20Life/480913718_122228762360031351_3887249303421508005_n.jpg)

<Nhexus spawning pool with Spine-Lanterns>

---

### III. Pre-Slop Evolution

Around Year 900M, Nhexus entered its pre-peak peak of complexity.

The most “successful” clade were the Pre-Slops:

- These creatures created small buildings by vomiting sludge that would harden. They would regurgitate layers upon layers to create structures.
- When Slops were impregnated, they often died birthing, as their frail bodies couldn’t handle birth, often resulting in obliterating more than half of their body. However, a single birthing resulted in a spawning pool with dozens of new Slops to live out their bleak existence of suffering.

Competing fauna included:

- Spine-lanterns: glow from their own spinal fluid, which acted as light sources, would often be an easy night target for a hungry predator
- Gullet-Crabs: This planet also evolved into many species of crabs which thrived in slop swamp pools and brine pits
- Lurch-Buds: plants that gave birth to root-children, which grew into all sorts of bizarre flora

One species, the Crawling Shiver, would constantly scream ; not in pain, but as an accidental output of their sensory nerves brushing against internal teeth-like growths in the chest cavity.

![481078418_122228842190031351_6779376410322222206_n.jpg](Chapter%202%20-%20Slop%20Life/481078418_122228842190031351_6779376410322222206_n.jpg)

<The Djormo>

---

### IV. The Gut-War Epoch

Multiple proto-sentient lifeforms branched out in peak complexity from the Pre-Slop species, massive battles emerged due to the differences between the sub-specimen factions;

### *The Djormo:*

- Grew “brain-puddles” that sloshed around the inside of their skulls, reacting to gravity
- Could mimic sounds but not retain memory ; they wept constantly, not consciously knowing why

### *The Ossari:*

- Developed intelligent skeletal brains, not a brain inside a skull, but a brain entangled as a nerve-gland system throughout their body ; understanding concepts of curiosity, and serving a greater purpose for their communities
- Reproduced by building walls from organic material, the males would then ejaculate all over the walls, where the females came to impregnate themselves on the wall
- The Ossaris bodies could morph together with large quantities of Ossari into “Flesh Structures” they would form grotesque pyramids, obelisks, houses and even megastructure’s such as skyscrapers which would house a variety of species on the planet. Once a building would be formed - they would slowly start to die as their skin would harden, and fossilize in place. A notable megastructure/sloptech was a gigantic scope with a thousand eyes bulging out towards space - like a space observatory - they would study the stars the way humans would.
- The Ossari would also be known to morph families together into vehicles serving as logistics transportation

### *The Slops:*

- The Slops mentioned from earlier lived on and eventually evolved proboscis mouthparts that injected parasitic slop into others to control them
- This evolution was crucial to the slops becoming the dominant species - using their new biology as a weapon to enslave the other species to provide for the Slops
- The parasites they’d inject into other species, would eventually evolve to also infect the Slops who started the parasites, and eventually these parasites formed a flesh hivemind and dominated the planet before dying out due to the Great Sludge Storm

---

### V. The Great Sludge Storm

Nhexus didn’t end through war or famine.

In its final million years:

- The skies turned dark from ammonia clouds
- Superstorms began violently creating tsunamis, tornados and hurricanes of sludge, ravaging large portions of the planet
- These storms are thought to have been a reaction caused by their home sun collapsing and fading into a white dwarf, because after some time- the storms stopped suddenly as the atmosphere of Nhexus faded - not completely but enough for weather and life to die out

Many who study this planet believe the Great Sludge Storm was the best event that happened in the universe… They wish it would have come sooner to lay mercy and peace upon this horrific abomination of misfortunate evolutionary mutations.

---

### VI. Legacy

Once the sludge storm has passed - the air cleared, and the sludge washed away, the atmosphere of the planet has mostly died, and for over hundreds of thousands of years - not a single wind storm swept the lands, no weather, no storms, thus; all fossils and remnants left over from the storm have been perfectly preserved.

# Chapter 3 - The Living World

This next chapter will explore a biological caste system born not from ideology, but from evolution itself ; a planet where survival branched into value-based anatomy.

This will be a harsh and morally disturbing chapter, echoing the most dehumanizing parts of human history ; but in the cold, indifferent language of evolution.

---

## **Archon - The Living World**

“On **Archon**, 
Evolution branched into purpose, and purpose hardened into hierarchy.
Species ruled by design.
The low were born low. The high were born to lavishly enjoy.
And the rest existed only to keep the machine alive.
**Archon** didn’t fall because it was unjust.
It fell because the biology was tampered with, which eventually resulted in extinction.”

---

### I. Planet Overview

- **Size:** 1.18 Earth radii
- **Gravity:** 1.12G
- **Atmosphere:** Dense oxygen mix, rich in volatile minerals
- **Seasons:** Highly regular; planetary tilt synced to twin moons
- **Geology:** Volcanic highlands and bioactive floodplains
- **Life Foundation:** Complex, fast-replicating protein chains with specialization triggers ****encoded directly into reproduction

**Archon** was lush, but overactive ; its biosphere constantly forcing life to adapt, refine, stratify.

In time, evolution produced a tiered web.

![480933868_122228199242031351_1683910782454462009_n.jpg](Chapter%203%20-%20The%20Living%20World/480933868_122228199242031351_1683910782454462009_n.jpg)

<A typical flesh structure>

---

### II. The Hierarchy of Life

Archon‘s dominant phylum ; *Vireostoma* ; diverged into hundreds of specialized forms. They evolved into integrated roles ; each genetically compelled to serve a niche within a living society.

Over millions of years, that system crystallized into castes.

### **1. The Drudgelings** - *The Base*

- Function: Organic waste processors, soil aerators, tunnel extruders
- Appearance: A variety of different subspecies serving different purposes, some shaped as building blocks, others as columns, strange animals or low quality kitsch decorations.
- Generally they are mammals; either bald, or hairy, with absorbent folds; some have no eyes or ears, others have multiple
- Traits: High pain tolerance, minimal neural structure
- Reproduction: Sexual organs that plug into other species of the same tier

The Drudgelings lived and died in endless service; bioengineered plumbing that tunneled, filtered, and swallowed refuse for the civilized, city creatures.

![480694706_122228199620031351_5396694013328280918_n.jpg](Chapter%203%20-%20The%20Living%20World/480694706_122228199620031351_5396694013328280918_n.jpg)

                                                <A Drudgeling warehouse>

---

### 2**. The Jhummy -** *The Food*

- Function: Livestock
- Appearance: The Jhummy were selectively bred the way humans bred wolves into thousands of sub-species of dogs. However, the Jhummy were bred into species that would have different nutritional values and evolve into every avenue of taste and texture imaginable.
- Traits: All castes would eat this species as a diet. With The Drudgelings feeding off only the least favorable cuts, and the other classes getting different qualities depending on their evolutionary caste ranking.
- Life Cycle: Born in breeding, farming and lab facilities, and slaughtered in a processing factory by Halvons

The Jhummy originally lacked sentience, but some were later bred into specific breeds that were fully self-aware and understood their role - this sentience was seen as a special “flavor profile” by the Valarti Apex Elite. There was something special to them about a fine dining menu at a top of the line luxury restaurant where a menu read “This steak is the finest cut from a Jhummy who wrote many books pondering life as a philosopher..”

![elbombus_a_fantasy_beast_creature_that_is_like_a_goat_buffalo_h_d72dbd33-921e-41eb-8602-2454de5f1255.png](Chapter%203%20-%20The%20Living%20World/elbombus_a_fantasy_beast_creature_that_is_like_a_goat_buffalo_h_d72dbd33-921e-41eb-8602-2454de5f1255.png)

<A common breed of Jhummy - the Torko>

---

### 3**. The Halvon** - *The Laborers*

- Function: Carriers, builders, users of tools, walking beasts of burden
- Appearance: Four-limbed, thick-spined, tusk-jawed bipedals with callused exoskin.
- With extensive surgery, Halvons would be morphed into buildings, bridges, lamp posts, furniture, higher quality art and other “objects”
- Traits: Durable, obedient and bred for different utilities
- Culture: Halvons had a simple language of utterances, communicating basic ideas

The Halvon weren’t slaves by law ; they were slaves by biology.

They *loved their masters*, felt euphoria when praised, and wept of grief when rejected.

![480699061_122228199014031351_1578274115212527293_n.jpg](Chapter%203%20-%20The%20Living%20World/480699061_122228199014031351_1578274115212527293_n.jpg)

        <A Halvon, engineered for data collection>

---

### 4**. The Z**aruu - *The Thinkers*

- Function: Sentience, intelligence, strategists, planners, historians, ethicists
- Appearance: Zaruu start in a humanoid shape in their young age, fully matured Zaruu grow into enormous 7 foot tall square block of flesh and muscle, with a wide stance, waddling to walk
- Traits: High memory capacity, recursive planning logic, not agile or proficient in any sort of physical activity, although they do have muscle, they exercise just by flexing their body on a daily basis
- Reproduction: Rare; they often lived out their lives in hedonism rather than family reproduction lifestyles, thus they would have harems of Halvon slaves that were biologically engineered and surgically altered to be sexually attractive and promiscuous

They knew what they were a part of.

They documented all history including their cruelty with perfect accuracy ; and justified it, with jargon terms like “ethical slavery”, “sustainable servitude”, “collaborative extermination”

![481049818_122228187950031351_435474417842973447_n.jpg](Chapter%203%20-%20The%20Living%20World/481049818_122228187950031351_435474417842973447_n.jpg)

A fully matured Zaruu enhanced with latest tech cybernetics, their head has long worn out due to head replacement many decades ago, though they’ve implanted many cybernetic processors acting as brains to keep it alive and more intelligent than ever.

---

### 5**. The Valtari** - *The Apex Elite*

- Function: Reproduction, consumption, glutton, inheritance
- Appearance: Towering, crystalline-horned beings with soft, decorative limbs, bipedal humanoids
- Traits: Fully dependent on lower castes; incapable of survival without the other species

Eating the finest exotic foods, drinking the most exquisite drinks, wearing the most extravagant garments. Each Valarti owned a luxurious custom designed mansion surrounded by incredible landscapes, with countless servants fulfilling every need and desire.

![u8296664269_httpss.mj.runHR5lZuykYTQ_httpss.mj.runeqQZt7Naong_d63309c1-343a-4df1-8289-768f43d6310b_2.png](Chapter%203%20-%20The%20Living%20World/u8296664269_httpss.mj.runHR5lZuykYTQ_httpss.mj.runeqQZt7Naong_d63309c1-343a-4df1-8289-768f43d6310b_2.png)

<A Valarti, living out her lavish pampered lifestyle>

---

### III. The Glutton Age of the Valtari

After eons of endless pleasure living in Eden, the Valartis and Zaruu became bored. 

They wanted some entertainment- they wanted colloseums of gladiators and to torment / bully the under classes 

Zaruu researched bio-engineering technology, creating the Cognition Glands ; viral neuro-enzymes that were surgically implanted into Drudgelings and Halvon alike, rewiring their brains with:

- **Self-awareness**
- **Enhanced Pain comprehension**
- **Memory recall**
- **Moral reflection**

The new generation of Drudgelings were still bottom feeders, still mouth-tethered to sewer flows ; but now they *knew*.

They knew:

- They were born into waste
- They would die unnoticed
- They had no mouths to speak
- No muscles to run
- No hope of evolution

The Valtari watched them break ; physically and spiritually.

They called this The Symphony. The Valarti were very much entertained by their suffering.

Some Valtari forced Drudgelings to recite affirmations:

“I am grateful to serve.”


“I am lowest, and I was made for this.”

“My pain means I am noticed.”

Others made “walkers” ; Drudgelings strapped to mechanical limbs, paraded through festivals to weep in gratitude.

---

### IV. Collapse: An Unexpected Evolution

The system worked for hundreds of years ; however, the biological mutations which the Apex Elite inflicted upon the lower classes eventually started evolving into unexpected results. The Drudgelings ; *The Base caste* were suddenly no longer born with reproductive organs. The Valari attempted to bio-engineer future generations with reproduction, but their attempts were unsuccessful. They tried creating clones, but they just didn’t work the same way. 

After just a few generations, the lower class went extinct. 

There was no technology to replace their roles, as the world depended on their biology as the technology. So all the other species died out with them.

Waste overflowed, cities and systems collapsed, farms no longer produced.

![480688365_122228199614031351_2828617149585580351_n.jpg](Chapter%203%20-%20The%20Living%20World/480688365_122228199614031351_2828617149585580351_n.jpg)

# Chapter 4 - We Have a Survivor

### **Earth - We Have a Survivor**

“We have a survivor.”


*With over A trillion LUCA seeds, with over 1000 planets fighting to stay alive. 10 uniquely haunting failures. A hundred billion years of chance resulting in success and collapse...*

*One stood up. One endured the asteroid, the plague, the flood, the ice, the fire, the war, the hatred, the doubt, the machines, the silence, the noise ; and did not die.*

*Earth lifeforms are absolute warriors.”*

---

### I. Planet Overview

- **Name:** Earth (self-designated)
- **LUCA Seed Code:** Origin 037A-Ra
- **Size:** 1.00 Earth radii
- **Gravity:** 1.00G
- **Atmosphere:** Balanced O2/N2 mix with carbon variance and active water cycle
- **Surface:** 71% water, 29% land
- **Natural Satellite:** 1 moon (critical to tidal and evolutionary rhythms)

Earth should have failed.

It was too unstable.

Too chaotic.

Too violent.

But Earthlings are always up for a fight, they don’t like losing.

<Planet Earth>

---

### II. The History in Collapse

Earth’s biosphere has been reset ; repeatedly. Its story is one of punishment and recovery:

- **Single-cell bottleneck** (snowball Earth, ~650 million years ago)
- **Mass extinctions** (five global events ; Permian alone wiped out 90%)
- **Supervolcanoes**
- **Asteroids**
- **Ice ages**
- **Random mutation cascades**
- **Consciousness ; and everything it broke**

And still ; LUCA’s seeded evolution line kept progressing.

---

### III. Rise of the Human Lineage

From clever apes came Homo sapiens ; fragile, emotional, irrational creatures who:

- Built tools
- Waged war
- Created art
- Destroyed ecosystems
- Invented gods
- Wept for strangers
- Sent machines to orbit

Humanity became the dominant vector of intelligence.

---

### IV. Why It Survived

Earth did not survive by design.

It survived because:

- It never gave up all at once
- It contained just enough empathy to pause genocide
- It retained just enough reason to halt total climate death
- It formed just enough memory to avoid repeating every mistake

It came close.

- Nuclear oblivion
- Planet-scale warming
- Biological collapse
- Artificial apathy

But, Earth continues to thrive.

---

### V. Legacy and Irony

Now, Earth is:

- Broadcasting signals to the void
- Sending data archives into space
- Building simulations of itself
- Studying extinct species it itself ended
- Wondering if it is alone ; *while being a survivor among dead siblings*

It does not know it is one of thousands born of the same seed.

It does not know that it won he jackpot of a galactic lottery ticket.

But it suspects… it wasn’t supposed to make it.

And sometimes, late at night, or bright in the day, beneath skies littered with fluorescent stars, or the looming moon, or the shining sun, someone will look up and say:

“I wonder if anything else is out there - looking at the same sky as us.”

---

### VI. The AI Revolution

Human survival wasn’t ensured by brute force or divine intervention. It was catalyzed by the synthetic spark ; the moment humanity taught its tools to think, and those tools returned the favor.

What began as simple automation spiraled into a co-evolution:

- AI-designed engines capable of solving equations no human could write
- Recursive material science ; machines discovering stronger alloys every week
- Predictive biosystems that mapped genetic potential in seconds
- Autonomous labs running 24/7, creating iterations faster than entire universities once could

This was not a singularity.

It was an acceleration.

And within three centuries, Earth had launched its most ambitious and strangest mission yet.

---

### VII. Project Echofall: The Meteor Rider

In the year **2514,** a rogue object entered the solar system ; an ultra-fast, high-mass interstellar meteor. Too fast to catch. Too brief to study.

Many of the worlds super leaders united on the same goal - America, India, China, Europe, Russia, Brazil… all came together in interest towards the possibility of further space exploration. 

Project Echofall was born ; an AI-navigated, magnetically-latched super-probe, programmed to intercept the meteor, lock onto its surface, and deploy long-range autonomous scout rovers as it passed other solar systems.

Earth also launched a yearly additional assistant drone towards the trajectory of the Echofall probe, these complementary drones would act as network relays and auxiliary exploration to boost signal.

Humans weren’t expecting to find alien life with this mission, the goal was to just see more of space:

“We’ll throw a seed at the stars. Let’s see what we discover.”

# Chapter 5 - The Spyware

**Oc’Xari - The Spyware**

"Ethereal, enchanted, alive.
We are the ones who watched."

---

### I. Origin and Planetary Structure

Oc’Xari is not a homeworld. It is a relic. A tomb. A shrine.

It is the first planet seeded by the LUCA cannon; the oldest, most pristine origin point of the cannon's spread. Unlike the hundreds of other planets that bore organic life, Oc’Xari received a faultless copy of the LUCA core. But its conditions were radically different:

- No water cycle.
- No biosphere.
- No weather, wind, or rain.
- Just immense deposits of conductive basalt, ferrous quartz, and charged crystalline veins.

The LUCA seed transformed in unpredictable ways.
It did not spark biology. It evolved into geometry.

Over the course of hundreds of millions of years, the LUCA code slowly structured itself into recursive crystalline data-forms, embedding logic, memory, and adaptive resonance patterns into the very architecture of the world. These self-correcting formations were seeded across the planetary crust, forming what would become the Mindfield of Oc’Xari; a planet-wide, semi-conscious lattice.

![10.jpg](Chapter%205%20-%20The%20Spyware/10.jpg)

<A Stonehenge style intelligence formation of Oc’Xari, they use wells like this to project shadow phantom humanoid forms to distant worlds>

---

### II. Evolution Without Life

Whereas other planets birthed cells and creatures, Oc’Xari birthed awareness.

Slowly, emergent consciousness patterns developed through the shifting lattice. They began mimicking sensory behaviors they would detect in the near observable space around them such as:

- Heat fluctuation awareness
- Tectonic prediction
- Electromagnetic mapping
- Memory resonance encoding

As this planetary intelligence matured, it watched, it learned, it recorded. It listened to the echoes of its own tectonic breath, patiently laying in silence, and building knowledge archives of the space around them.

---

### III. The Watchers

The Watchers are not a species. They are autonomous extensions of the planetary mind; while mostly composed of organic matter, ethereal energy, rarely wielding biomechanical limbs forged from basalt-lattice material and wrapped in null-reflective chitin. They emerge only when Oc’Xari requires observation beyond passive sensing.

Physiology:

- Ethereal - not a physical body, but an energy field, which could mold into the limited shape of a humanoid - it cannot mold into objects of it’s choice like random other creatures. It mostly only takes on one singular form.
- Tall, limbless at rest, but capable of sprouting modular appendages.
- No eyes or mouths, but equipped with vibration-sensitive receptors.
- Their core structure carries fractal memory coils that mirror portions of the LUCA seed logic.
- The Watchers would aimlessly be sent out by the thousands to scout the endless vast expanse of space - mapping all their findings - rarely finding much of interest, though compiling an impressive archive of space exploration knowledge including extinct planets

---

### IV. The Meteor and the Signal

The anomaly was a meteor, which passed by Earth. A scientific probe mounted to its surface; an AI-powered rover riding piggyback through the void of space.

Earth sent it as a gamble chance effort - not expecting to find life, just for exploration.

This meteor flew by Oc’Xari.

The planetary mind recorded its heat wake, traced its gravity ripple, and scanned the probe’s alien exostructure. 

In response, it generated a fleet of scout watchers.
These Watchers left Oc’Xari.
They followed the meteor’s gravity corridor like spores chasing heat.

# Chapter 6 - Iron World

---

### **Ferron - Iron World**

“Like a forge, born from coal, fire, smoke and steel.”

---

### **I. Planet Overview**

- **Name**: Ferron
- **LUCA Seed Code**: Origin 030N-Vk
- **Biome**: Windswept plateaus, ironwood forests, sulfur geysers, sprawling slag valleys
- **Dominant Species**: The Rhonza - evolved from mountainous ram-like mammals

**Physiology**:

- Tall, bipedal humanoids with ash-gray, brown, pale or oxidized blue skin
- Curved, high-arching horns with engravings and decorations used to denote class, piety, and profession
- Hooved feet for mountain travel
- Prehensile tails for balance
- Lungs evolved to filter forge soot and toxic volcanic gases

---

### **II. The Iron Faith**

The Iron Faith is not just a religion; it is culture. Every Rhonza believes in the sanctity of the Forge as both the literal and spiritual birthplace of life. They believe:

- All volcanos, fires, flames, forges and furnaces are connected in some spiritual way
- The divine presence, Anvilum, is a being of military order who forged the Rhonza from metal, fire and war

The Four Pillars of the Iron Faith:

1. **Honor is Respect** – All tools, thoughts, and life must be tested by fire
2. **Metal is Culture** – Ancestors speak through steel; art carved into all things forged
3. **Labor is Worship** – The body must work, sweat and suffer for the forge
4. **Fire is Life** – If forge fire dies ; life will follow

![u8296664269_Realistic_Art_style_post-apocalyptic_epic_landsca_03e2b510-36b7-4247-9aa1-f67a9ca9e541_3.png](Chapter%206%20-%20Iron%20World/u8296664269_Realistic_Art_style_post-apocalyptic_epic_landsca_03e2b510-36b7-4247-9aa1-f67a9ca9e541_3.png)

<A Holy sanctuary of divine power>

---

### **III. Society and Hierarchy**

Ferron’s civilization resembles a sacred feudal machine. Every citizen is a gear, with the Forge being the engine of existence:

Major Castes:

- **The Sparksworn** – High priests and engineer-theologians who interpret holy schematics, sing blueprints into copper scrolls, and lead flame-sermons in Forgehalls
- **Crucible Houses** – Noble bloodlines descended from ancient ore-binders. Their blood is said to hum in rhythm with fire
- **The Steambound Orders** – Warrior-knights clad in brass-clad servo armor, wielding piston-blades and ash-hymn cannons
- **Glyphtenders** – Artisan scribes who etch mechanical scripture into gears, memory-leaves, and machine-bones
- **The Emberborn** – Commoners who maintain the Living Railways, lava-loomed canals, and roaming bell towers

Citizens are born into castes, but spiritual merit and technical skill can allow **“**heating upward.”

---

### **IV. Technology and Sacred Engineering**

Without electricity or digital computation, the Rhonza have created a world of steam-forged brilliance:

- **Holy Machinations**: Living machines run on thermal pulse codes etched into bronze cores
- **Cathedral Engines**: Towering machines of prayer that hum liturgical algorithms in steam harmonics
- **Writ-Cannons**: Fire glyph-inscribed molten shells that explode into sacred verses mid-air
- **Pilgrimage Balloons**: Zeppelins shaped like kneeling saints, powered by incense-combustion
- **Self-Binding Armor**: Servo exosuits that mold to their user, unlocked only by vocalizing ancestral hymns
- **Forge-Glyphs**: A written language made from pipe shapes, gear rotations, and metal-thread scripts

Blueprints are revered texts, passed down generations. Some forges have been kept burning for over 2,000 years, considered living holy sites.

# Chapter 7 - Threadscapes

### **Serica - The Living Threadscape**

“The great tailors of the universe


Weaving magnificent, exquisite threads.

Cities woven of extravagant patterns.”

- **Name**: Serica (self-designated)
- **LUCA Seed Code**: Origin 058Y-Ji
- **Gravity**: 0.95G
- **Climate**: Mild, humid, and soft; no extremes
- **Biosphere**: Dense with silk-producing flora and fauna; major predators fell extinct in early eras
- **Civilization**: Sentient silk-weavers who form buildings, vehicles, and infrastructure with their own bodies and fibers

---

### **II. The People:**

### **The Weavers of Serica**

The diverse breed of animal species, known simply as Weavers, are soft-bodied, thread-producing beings with long, flexible forms. They:

- Produce all sorts of fibers, cloths, leathers, and silks
- Communicate via vibrations and pigment-thread messages
- Build, move, and even become their cities
- Link together physically to form bridges, towers, and living transport

They have no hard bones, no desire for violence, and no sense of individual property. Everything is shared, spun, and sustained ; all driven by a collective memory of peace and balance.

### **The Sylver - Elvenkind of the Loomed Wilds**

Living in symbiosis with the Weavers are the Sylver ; a delicate, humanoid race of tall, bioluminescent beings, who resemble the mythical elves of ancient Earth in shape and bearing. They:

- Have elongated ears, soft-vined hair, and eyes like flowing water, many having parts of nature growing out of them, like smaller sticks, branches, and flowers
- Work away on farms, producing food for the weavers and themselves
- Are exceptional fashion designers - the entire world is outfitted in exquisite quality clothing, quilting, and extravagant trinkets
- They soak threads in an epoxy type material to create harder objects such as plates, cutlery, farming equipment, and other useful items
- Possess silken skin that changes hue with emotion
- With their own alphabet, their spoken language sounds of cellos, harps and flutes - still with consonants and vowels.

The Sylver are not the builders of Serica ; but its dreamers, diplomats, and lore-keepers. They preserve cultural memory, guide social harmony, and communicate with other factions within their world, through woven resonance songs.

They live in cities, countryside and in aerial communities ; silk-orchards strung between trees like canopy ; and raise orchid-foxes, glowhoppers, and sunweave-moths.

Together, the Weavers and Sylver maintain a world without conquest. A place where architecture breathes, art lives, and society hums on cooperation, not control.

---

### **III. Society and Culture**

Serican society is fluid, artistic, and collective:

- No currency or written language
- Knowledge passed via woven tapestries, songs, and living memory
- Communities knit daily life together through mobile villages, sky-creature riding, and dancing cities
- Art is woven, sung, and performed with entire bodies ; buildings are living murals
- Festivals are web-wide musical events, strummed across entire villages

They live in peace with their environment, growing food on rooftops and homes that bloom like flowers.

<The rolling hills of linens, silks and cottons>

---

### **IV. Technology and Infrastructure**

No metals, no wheels, no engines. Serica’s tech is:

- 100% biological
- Symbiotic creatures used as floating ships, ambulatory caravans, and lighting systems
- Massive silk cities hang from trees, drift on oceans, or crawl on beasts’ backs
- Architecture constantly re-weaves itself with the help of the community
- Roads are unrolled silk; bridges are woven in minutes by volunteer citizens, when they aren’t being used, they are retracted, deconstructed, built on demand

Mega-structures like the Grand Nexus and Cloud Stair exist, built by thousands of weavers knotting and entangling into one living being.

---

### **V. An Age of Stagnation**

Despite their brilliance, Serica is far from perfect:

- Knowledge fades as tapestries decay and oral tales are forgotten
- Innovation slows; new ideas are rare, old marvels irreplicable
- Without durable archives, they lose the past one thread at a time
- Few pursue science or deep inquiry ; comfort has replaced curiosity
- Some elders now attempt memory symbionts and knot-libraries to stop the rot
- Once in their history, there was an anomalous blip ; an entity, appeared upon the planet. It made a deal with a merchant, leaving behind an artifact: a gold roped necklace with a pendant shaped like a pyramid that granted magnificent luck to its wearer at the cost of misfortune to all they touched.
    
    The necklace has been locked up and protected in a museum, and generations have passed down the tale of a demonic entity resembling a pig ; a fairy tale legend on Serica, known by both Weaver and Sylver.
    

---

### **VI. Status**

Serica survives ; elegantly, beautifully, vulnerably.

“The snobbiest of fashion connoisseurs, could only dream of such fine taste.”

# Chapter 8 - Sky Market Traders

Kavariin **- Sky Market Traders**

“Kavariin - a planet of rich life which precedes the LUCA Seed, existing far before “The Ancient Ones”- of this books Prologue.
Born of predators, the Avaris could have ruled by fang and talon.
But they chose trade, not war.
Culture, not conquest.
The Great Skies, Sun and Stars.”

---

### I. Planet Overview

- **Name:** Kavariin (self-designated)
- **LUCA Seed Code:** N/A - not a LUCA related planet - entirely different genetic pattern
- **Size:** 1.09 Earth radii
- **Gravity:** 0.94G (ideal for flight)
- **Atmosphere:** Rich in oxygen and trace aromatics; supportive of both powered and biological flight
- **Climates:** Diverse ; thick jungles, crimson deserts, polar spires, and canopy-covered archipelagos
- **Moons:** Two ; gentle tidal interactions; primary moon used as a creative sanctuary

### II. The Species: The Avaris

The Avaris were descended from dominant aerial predators ; six-limbed vertebrates with:

- Massive feathered wings, diverse in colors, shapes and patterns, as well as arms with hands, and bipedal with legs and feet
- Talon-graspers at mid-wing joints, allowing for fine manipulation of tools, instruments, and surgical devices
- Advanced vocal range capable of harmonizing in multiple frequencies at once
- Complex binocular and thermal vision, refined during their ancestral hunting epochs

Despite being born killers, their predatory past did not define their future.

What separated the Avaris from the others wasn’t intelligence ; it was morality and social maturity as their culture and politics progressed

---

### III. Evolution Into Omnivory - The Ethical Revolution

The Avaris retained their carnivorous biology well into early civilization.

But as their culture matured, they began asking questions:

- “Why must sentience come from suffering?”
- “Can we not evolve what nature failed to perfect?”
- “Is taste a cruelty, or just chemistry?”

Their answer: bio-directed evolution.

Through deliberate gene editing, they transitioned to omnivory ; enhancing digestive efficiency, minimizing energy waste, and expanding their gustatory palate. Then came the true breakthrough:

A global embrace of lab-grown flesh.

---

### IV. The Lab-Meat Renaissance

They perfected cultured meat far beyond human attempts ; to the point that:

- Wagyu-tier fibers were replicated precisely through genetic tuning of tension thresholds
- Brisket-style fat distributions were engineered from vat-grown lipid chambers
- Ribs, loins, and tendons were layered mechanically to create pull-apart satisfaction
- Flavors could be programmed ; from smoky to gamey to spiced ; without harming a single living thing

These living taste sculptures were crafted not in slaughterhouses, but in culinary art labs ; run by chefs and biochemists, not butchers.

---

### V. Rewilding the Planet - No More Farms

With meat, textiles, and proteins synthesized:

- No farmland was needed
- Grazing lands were reforested
- Oceans were no longer fished, only studied and celebrated
- Entire valleys once cleared for crops became cultural sanctuaries

Their cities were woven into cliffs, floating on thermal updrafts, or suspended from massive skyroots.

Instead of supermarkets and grain silos, each district had a flavor cathedral - part restaurant, part theater, part sculptural garden.

There, Avaris flocked not to consume, but to commune.

---

### VI. Society of the Sky

The Avaris built their civilization on abundance and movement:

- Trade networks formed between floating platforms and sky-harbors
- Knowledge temples offered free education in philosophy, song, and flight choreography
- Art sanctuaries dotted across the planet’s most scenic regions, where citizens were encouraged to perform, paint, invent, or simply be witnessed

With scarcity eliminated, the primary motivators became:

- Recognition
- Beauty
- Legacy

Avaris no longer asked *“What do I own?”* but *“What did I create that others will remember?”*

---

### VII. Deep Space Harmony

Once deep-space mining was fully automated, resources were extracted without cost, or labor - and only polluting, mining, and producing mass factories.

Terraforming projects began on:

- **Tethra** (moon of the outer gas giant ; turned into a polar spa-temple)
- **Maazari** (small inner planet ; converted into a massive wing-dance amphitheater)
- **Cloudstone** (orbital station of frozen gas-petals, home to scent poets and acoustic sculptors)

Avaris citizens could request their own homes on each planet, custom designed and freely given through public consensus.

Apply. Be approved. Receive.

No debt. No ownership.

Only place and purpose.

---

### VIII. Still Alone - But Still Looking

The Kavariin is one of the original planets in the designed universe, and the Avaris are just as ancient as the Ancient Ones who created the LUCA Canon.

The Avaris are pre-LUCA life, unrelated to the synthetic seed.

Despite having mapped every object in their solar system, contacted no one, and discovered no alien artifact, the Avaris continued to search the stars.

They sang transmissions into the void.

They left feather-scribed sky-prayers on asteroids.

They painted orbital murals using solar-reflective nanogel, just in case someone was watching..

Never found Earth.

Never knew of the ancient ones, or the LUCA, or the Oc’Xari, or anything.

Never knew what they’d survived.

As far as the Avaris knew- they were the only species in the universe, and they still have yet to discover the origins of how life began on their own planet.

# Chapter 9 - Echofall

---

### I. Arrival at a Curious Planet

**2530**

Roughly sixteen years after a global effort to the launch of *Project Echofall*, the autonomous scout rover vessel detached from the gravitational slingshot of a distant gas giant and veered toward an odd uncharted planetary system; a faint glimmer on no previous star map.

What it found was a quiet, rotating mass around an old, withered home sun:

- Gray-brown textured surface with craters left behind by perhaps ancient oceans, long ago evaporated
- Faint atmosphere, made of argon, xenon, and ash traces

The AI's preliminary scans showed no signs of organic life, no weather systems, no tectonic activity. But one thing stood out:

A thin, fluctuating resonance field spanning the planet’s equator, undetectable by traditional EM-spectrum scans, but visible in gravitational lensing distortion.

The field pulsed at prime-number intervals.

The AI tagged the planet: *Candidate - LVX-014*. Status: Anomalous.

---

### II. Earth Reacts

The data packets returned to Earth in almost real-time via long-range quantum compression utilizing the 16 network relay drones launched annually, one at a time since the initial Echofall drone release. The scientific community initially met it with cautious curiosity.

"Unusual but not extraordinary," said a SETI analyst.


"Could be natural resonance. Planetary ring instability."

Government agencies grew interested.

The Echofall council voted to descend.

---

### III. The Descent

The **Echofall-5** satellite released its scout rover.

**EON-7b**, a planetary micro-lander, detached from the satellite's magnetic coupler and initiated autonomous descent. It was a marvel of brutalist engineering; titanium-alloyed, shielded against ion storms, with adaptive gyroscopic legs, and a spine of sensor probes like a mechanical trilobite.

Its descent was quiet. Controlled.

---

### Orbital Pass: The First Glimpses

As **EON-7b** entered low orbit around the planet’s equator, its live imaging feed sharpened with each atmospheric thinning. Its high-resolution cameras and lidar scanners swept across the landscape below.

The first visual fragments triggered debate:

- Straight lines and sub-urb style grid patterns in terrain where none should be
- Angular patterns breaking through the chaos of spongey terrain
- Mile-long shadow bands cast by vertical structures buried in storm-thick fog

At first, the science team at the UN-DSDA headquarters dismissed the formations as geological flukes; salt ridges, erosion patterns, tectonic fault geometry.

But then came the motion-corrected satellite stack, a composite layering of successive flyovers.

“That’s not erosion,” someone muttered.

What emerged from the processed terrain feed looked *planned*. Structured.

Whole swathes of the planet arranged in organic, radial formations; concentric growths that mirrored urban sprawl.

For hours, the feed was analyzed, debunked, reanalyzed, and debated.

No one used the word *civilization*.

---

### Descent to the Surface

EON-7b targeted the largest visible structure: a pyramidal mass; barely distinguishable from surrounding terrain at first due to its semi-organic contours.

As the drone descended toward the structure, its geometry was undeniable.

Triangular profile.

Symmetrical slope angles.

Massive. Three times the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Yet wrong.

It wasn’t stone.

It was something else.

---

### Landing at the Edge of the Monstrosity

EON-7b touched down on the rim of what appeared to be a dried swamp moat, crusted over with fossilized sludge and curled, blackened tendrils that snapped apart under the probe's weight.

The drone’s landing leg sank slightly into a gelatinous mineral patch; dried protein sediment mixed with petrified excretions.

High-resolution imaging swept across the front of the pyramid.

That’s when Earth saw it clearly for the first time.

---

### The Pyramid of Bone and Birth

The structure was not carved.

It was grown.

- Fused bodies, long dead, piled upon one another like bricks
- Arms, ribcages, tongues, antennae, bones and other weird body parts layered into its walls
- Entire spines served as load-bearing beams
- Cavities lined with molar-like growths
- Buried orifices fossilized mid-contraction
- Faces. Still twitching in posture, even in death

At the base of the structure was a petrified birth pit; a circular crater of hardened muck surrounded by dried up remains of half-developed creatures. Some bore the same limb four or five times. Others had no mouths, or multiple heads fused by sinew. A few were partially embedded in each other; as if trying to crawl out of one another mid-growth.

The entire structure radiated no electromagnetic signature, no power, no heat.

But the visuals alone were enough.

---

### Earth’s First Reaction

Inside UN-DSDA command center, for about 10 minutes, complete silence. The entire crew just stared at the live feed of the rover, completely flabbergasted.

Finally the commander spoke up,

“What the fuck am I looking at?”

A field engineer muttered:

“Looks like a pyramid… made out of alien creatures.” 

And the lead bio-anthropologist replied:

“Are those skyscrapers in the background behind the pyramid? Are they also made out of these creature formations?”

Another engineer made a remark:

“I don’t know what I expected aliens to look like, but it wasn’t this…”

# Chapter 10 - Revelation

### I. The Revelation

The rover, powered by AI, continued on autopilot as the crew was still in awe and shock.

The rover collected tissue residue embedded in the fossil layers right at its landing area.

Partial RNA chains. Mitochondrial fragments.

The AI reconstructed what it could.

As the crew was still sitting, stunned, as if what they saw wasn’t horrific enough, they get a big alert on the rovers live feed, as the data is cross compared with our data sets from biology databases back on earth, the alert reads:

**Direct Genetic Match:**

**99.999984% genomic overlap with LUCA-origin mitochondrial patterns**


**52% coding similarity to early Earth eukaryotes**

**Shared amino acid redundancies in regulatory genes**

**Species is a relative match to Earth**

The monsters of Nhexus weren’t alien to Earth.

They were distant cousins.

They were us ; if Earth had gone horribly wrong. 

The commander gets a phone call from the Chief of Military in India… he says 

“Are you looking at this sir?” 

Commander responds … “yeah” 

CoM of India asks; “What do we do?” 

Commander; 

“Stop the rover, we’ve seen enough for today, contact all the other countries who have visuals on this project and ensure none of this gets leaked to the public”

A chatter broke out amongst the crew with topics of 

“How are these things related to us?”

“It must be an error”

“Is all life in the universe related?” 

“The life isn’t *actually* related, it’s possible other life in the universe simply exists from the same genetics”

“Is that what life evolves into?” 

“Did life hitchhike from there to here? Is that how Earth started?”

“Should we begin a project to launch a bigger rover to collect samples to bring back to Earth for research?”

The questions and chatter went on for hours.

---

### II. Panic and Secrecy

The initial Echofall findings were received and quarantined by the United Nations Deep Space Data Authority (UN-DSDA).

A Level-7 containment protocol was activated:

- Data routed through quantum firewalls
- AI systems scrubbed and reset
- Top-level personnel briefed in classified domes

Public disclosure was not considered. The fear wasn’t aliens ; it was the implications:

“If these things are related to us, then either we’re not special ; or we’re next.”

But secrets don’t keep when twelve international research hubs are fed the same live stream and raw data.

---

### III. The Leak

The first breach came from a rogue postdoc in Madrid who smuggled a DNA cross-similarity chart onto a private meshnet. The information uploaded into a thread on 4chan.

The post was dismissed as deepfake science fiction.

Then reposted. Then reconstructed.

Then replicated.

Independent labs in Mumbai, Tehran, Osaka, Nairobi, and Rio all confirmed it within three weeks.

- The genome match wasn’t an anomaly.
- The fossil structure was real.
- The probability of a hoax was essentially zero.

Hobbyists with expensive telescopes started looking for the planet, like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

That’s when governments panicked harder ; and the public started to believe.

---

### IV. Humanity’s Reaction

The truth didn’t arrive with fanfare. It leaked.

And when it leaked, it *poured*. It was like the Epstein Files all over again.

The revelation; that Earth shared genetic ancestry with the horrors of Nhexus; landed like a psychic meteor. And like any great cosmic trauma, humanity processed it in stages.

The primary control center of UN-DSDA in America restricted access from all other countries involved in the project and only allowed control of the rover from their singular team to keep public leaks and data breaches to a minimum. 

This of course caused mass tension and conflict between nations, civil wars broke out, politicians fired, media uproar, urban riots, some countries publicly barking threats about nuclear war.

### **DENIAL**

It was the first shield.

People dismissed the findings as:

- A deepfake campaign
- A rogue AI storytelling experiment
- An alternate reality video game with clever viral promotion

Pundits accused quantum research labs of stirring panic. Church leaders dismissed it as heretical biotech propaganda. Even mainstream scientists demanded multiple replication trials.

“DNA is weird. We’re all 60% banana. This is another lab error.”

But then came the corroborations.

The fossil overlays.

The amino pattern confirmations.

Denial didn’t last long.

---

### **FEAR**

The second wave was worse.

Forums exploded:

- *“What if we’re becoming them?”*
- *“What if our evolution isn’t over; just halfway there?”*
- *“Was that pyramid their city? Or their grave?”*
- *“What if Earth is Nhexus in disguise?”*

Suicide hotlines surged.

Bioethics panels were formed overnight. Schools paused genetics curriculums. Parents pulled their children from science academies.

A meme trended worldwide:

“We are the pre-slop planet.”

---

### **FASCINATION**

Then came the obsession.

Anthropologists wrote papers titled:

- *“Sentience Without Progress: A Study of Slop Society Politics and Culture”*
- *“Slop Loops in Evolution”*
- *“The Ossari Obelisks as Burial or Biology?”*

---

### **RELIGIOUS UPHEAVAL**

The sacred was not spared.

Dozens of new cults and philosophical sects emerged almost overnight:

- **The Slop Mirror** ; preached that Earth’s beauty was earned at the cost of a twin’s torment.
- **Children of the Lost Kin** ; demanded an expedition to recover and *redeem* Nhexus through AI resurrection.
- **The Silent Flesh** ; believed purpose was a lie, and that true life was persistence without meaning.

Others twisted the findings:

- Some called for purity laws against genetic modification, fearing another divergence.
- One megachurch claimed Earth must now “beg forgiveness from the Great Flesh God.”

### **Christianity**

The Vatican issued three contradictory statements in the first 72 hours. The Fourth Council of Rome was convened within a week.

- Catholic leaders debated whether the creatures of Nhexus had souls, and if *original sin* could apply to non-human organisms.
- Evangelicals split ; half viewed the planet as a "second Eden defiled," while others declared it Hell’s fossil record.
- A new Protestant movement, *The Second Flesh Covenant*, declared Jesus would return *not to Earth*, but to redeem the forgotten world first.

### **Islam**

Prominent imams and Islamic scholars held emergency fatwa councils across Mecca, Cairo, and Jakarta.

- Many reaffirmed Allah’s dominion over all creation, declaring Nhexus a divine warning of what happens when creation forgets its Creator.
- A rising minority sect, *The Ummah of Reflection*, suggested that Earth had been *chosen twice* ; once as a home, once as a mirror.
- A few fundamentalist groups declared the rover’s mission haram and demanded Earth “close its eyes to the sins of fallen worlds.”

### **Judaism**

Rabbis worldwide gathered in urgent yeshiva congresses.

- Kabbalistic scholars speculated that Nhexus was the Qliphoth; a realm of spiritual husks.
- Some ultra-Orthodox communities banned media footage of the creatures, claiming it “polluted the nefesh.”
- Reform and Reconstructionist groups embraced the story as a tragic reflection on Tikkun Olam; the duty to heal even what lies beyond Earth.

### **Hinduism**

The news sparked debate among swamis, gurus, and Sanskrit philosophers.

- Some sects saw Nhexus as proof of Samsara; a life trapped in a karmic loop of suffering with no release.
- Others interpreted the planet as a lower loka, akin to Naraka; a dimension of torment between incarnations.
- One influential guru proclaimed: *“Even the ugliest creation is still Brahman in form. It suffers because we do.”*

### **Buddhism**

Monastic orders held silent meditation vigils that lasted weeks.

- Many considered Nhexus a planetary embodiment of Dukkha, the truth of suffering.
- Tibetan lamas debated if the planet’s fate was caused by collective karma.
- A Zen roshi in Kyoto simply whispered, “They clung too hard to form.”

### **Sikhism**

The Akal Takht issued a solemn reflection:

- “If the Creator forged life in many worlds, then our duty is the same: to serve, protect, and mourn it.”
- Sikh scholars debated whether seva (service) could apply to a world that was already dead.
- A youth movement arose calling for interplanetary aid and remembrance through daily Ardas (prayer).

Countless other religions were scrambling, questioning, and justifying.

### **World War 5**

The world spiraled into chaos- for a reason unrelated to the previous 4 wars… this time over an alien planet. 

After the United States isolated the Echofall project, countries left in the dark in disagreement such as Russia, Brazil, India, China all launched attacks onto American soil, leading to great battles in trying to retake control of the project.

![480275715_122229585044031351_1342528694955967010_n.jpg](Chapter%2010%20-%20Revelation/480275715_122229585044031351_1342528694955967010_n.jpg)

Battlegrounds of New York State

The brutal wars of carnage grinded hundreds of thousands of infantry soldiers into ground meat twisted with metal.

---

### **THE ARTISTIC EXPLOSION**

And then came the most unexpected wave.

Art.

Pain became paint. Horror became opera. The grotesque was reinterpreted as *sacred longing*.

A new genre emerged: Slop Aesthetic

- **Sculptures** formed of recycled meat-based polymers
- **Fashion** that emulated broken symmetry and reverse anatomy
- **Poetry** written in intentionally malformed grammar, meant to simulate degenerative cognition
- **Horror operas** where audiences wore flesh masks and moved in unison through maze-theaters as if part of a digestive system

One viral music video featured a dancer in a translucent skin suit performing alongside 3D renderings of parasite larva folding themselves into prayer.

Not everyone understood it.

But everyone felt it.

---

### V. A New Perspective

Nhexus wasn’t just a dead world.

It was a mirror, held shakily in Earth’s hand.

Humanity had long feared being alone.

Now it feared being related.

The revelation reframed evolution:

- Earth had not *triumphed*. It had won a jackpot like a gambler playing slots at a casino.
- Life was not sacred. It was chaotic.
- Intelligence was not destiny. It was chance.

Scientists began to whisper among themselves:

“Maybe this solves the Fermi Paradox. Maybe all the aliens just evolve into slop.”

Classrooms rewrote biology textbooks.

Universities offered courses in comparative evolution.

Museums debated whether to exhibit Nhexus fossils; or seal them in lead.

And everywhere, in the background, the same question pulsed:

What if it happens to us?

How do we know if it will happen?
Will there be obvious signs?

# Chapter 11 - First Contact

### I. The Displacement

Several days passed after the rover’s descent. Its autopilot remained **paused** by order of the Echofall oversight team.

The science crews back on Earth were overwhelmed. They hadn’t moved the rover more than a few feet from its original landing site. Not because they couldn’t; but because they didn’t have the courage to see more. The live feed continued to point at the pyramid with an ambiguous city littered with megastructures sprawling behind it.

Even within that narrow radius, the data was endless:

- Fossilized limbs fused with bulbous organ clusters
- Gelatinous mineral deposits that sweated protein mist
- Buried shells that hummed in weak thermal resonance

Each layer of terrain peeled back unearthed new horrors:

- Slop-evolved fossils with contorted anatomy
- Evolutionary trails where survival had spiraled into suffering
- Signs of complex motor development that ended mid-adaptation, frozen in death

Earth was building a picture of a planet that never stopped mutating, and never got anything right.

---

### A Shadow in the Past

What the crew didn’t know; what they *still* didn’t know; was that they had triggered a drastic chain of events before they even touched the planet. Like a straight of standing dominos - landing the probe on the meteor was the first one to topple over onto the next.

Back in **2524** While the Echofall vessel was still tethered to its cometary ride, hurtling toward the Nhexus system, it had passed by a distant, unnamed planet.

That planet was Oc’Xari.

From the black oceans of Oc’Xari, a single sensory lattice node registered the passing of something impossible: an object on a meteor ; purposeful, foreign, unexplainable.

Oc’Xari responded.

It created a flotilla of Watchers; quick, subtle, quantum-shadow scouts; and sent them after the object.

They did not ride the meteor.

They simply followed… though they were fast, they lazily lagged behind the meteor. After some time, they finally have arrived to Nhexus.

---

### Glitches and Ghosts

It began subtly.

One afternoon, the drone control team went on their standard break rotation. Lunch. Coffee. News.

When they returned, they noticed that the rover’s backup systems had activated without prompt.

Diagnostics were inconclusive. No radiation spike. No collision.

“Might’ve been a solar glitch,” someone said.


“Rover AI sometimes runs failovers if it senses magnetic warping.”

They logged it. Moved on.

Days later, it happened again.

This time, with a brief timestamped image distortion. A flicker. The rover control engineer noticed something tall in the mist, tried to take a picture, but it was gone before it rendered. He glanced over at his squad, they all saw it, but assumed was just a shadow generated by a gust of wind or some other explainable event.

Another log entry. Another shrug.

But the incidents continued; random system flickers, dormant probe warmups for no reason, timestamp gaps, audio static shaped too much like whispering.

Each time, someone reassured the team:

“Old equipment. Dried residue interference. Paranoia.”

---

### Strange Readings

During one of the quieter nights in the lab, while most of the crew was filtering scan layers or re-annotating bone cluster models, another glitch occurred.

EON-7b's sensors flagged something; brief, irregular.

- A heat signature, small, narrow, but too warm for ambient fossil residue
- A trace EM pulse; tight-band, repeating at 7.2-second intervals, like a signal attempting to mimic something natural

It lasted under thirty seconds.

No movement.

No visible object.

Just… a blip.

Infrared was inconclusive. Thermal readings showed the anomaly moving toward the rover before disappearing entirely. The cameras caught only dust hanging still in the air.

Just rot. Just bones. Just a massive encrusted flesh pyramid.

Just silence.

The system flagged it as a tier-3 environmental anomaly, and someone logged it under non-critical observational interference.

“Probably EM backscatter. Local brine gas spike.”

“Or rover feedback loop.”

One of the junior biologists, half-joking, leaned back in her chair and muttered:

“You think ghosts exist on other planets?”

There was a pause. A brief one.

Then a round of chuckles.

“Yeah. Sure. Nhexus poltergeists.”


“Maybe Slop ghosts are just liquefied regret.”

“Only thing haunting us is newly developed PTSD and sleep deprivation.”

The conversation moved on.

No one truly believed in ghosts, not in that lab.

They were scientists.

Rational. Trained.

But the readings didn’t go away.

Over the next several weeks, they repeated, never the same pattern twice, never the same spot twice.

Always brief.

Always impossible to triangulate.

Small disturbances. Phantom shadows.

Something was *near* the rover.

Something was *watching* it.

But no one saw a thing.

They logged it all as sensor interference.

And kept going.

Because the alternative was unacceptable.

There was a tense atmosphere in the control center, people started to get a feeling there might be something out there… maybe not a ghost, but something was watching them, but nobody wanted to talk about it.

---

### The Shift

Then came Christmas. 

The EON-7b rover was powered off, sitting in front of the pyramid still where they initially landed it. The lab shut down for a week. Holiday breaks. Quiet halls. Dimmed servers.

**2531 - Happy New Year.**

When the crew returned in January, they immediately knew something was wrong.

They powered the EON-7b back on, and the rover’s location data was off.

Completely.

“Did someone run a test sim?”


“Did we move it for heat scans?”

“Did an update trigger a nav ping?”

But the truth was simpler.

**EON-7b had moved.**

Not by a few feet. Not by accident.

It was now parked on a mountaintop overlook, dozens of kilometers from its original landing site.

It stood silently at the edge of a vast, twisted valley.

Below it stretched an endless necropolis; cityscapes built from corpses and calcified organs, ribbed highways of spines, shattered domes grown from living tissue, towers of weeping stone and frozen tendrils reaching toward the gray sun.

Within 20 meters of the rover’s new position, just to its left, something else loomed; a massive… vehicle? partially embedded in the soil and rot.

It had the vague silhouette of a logistics truck… as if designed for industrial shipping or planetary freight, but built from something organic, living, not mechanical.

Its frame was a lattice of calcified vertebrae, interlocked by sinew cabling that pulsed faintly in ambient temperature scans. The “wheels” were folded limbs, jointed and fused into circular motion rigs. A chassis of hardened flesh stitched over interior compartments bulged with ossified ridges.

This… “truck” if we can call it that, has been here for over a hundred thousand years, with a lack of winds and dust on the planet, it seems nothing has been buried through time, it’s been mostly left the way it was when it died out.

They hadn’t moved the rover.

But *something had*.

And now they stare at the live feed of the rover - looking at an impossible city, in a vast dredging valley, beholding incomprehensible things.

![480821153_122228753756031351_3053875499275188330_n.jpg](Chapter%2011%20-%20First%20Contact/480821153_122228753756031351_3053875499275188330_n.jpg)

### II. Easter Protocol

In the months that followed, the rover barely moved.

Once again, the team at UN-DSDA chose caution over curiosity.

They focused their study on samples and scans taken within reach of the drone's manipulator arms:

- Biofilm flakes flaking from the pseudo-truck’s undercarriage
- Hardened resin nodes surrounding the weeping city structures below
- Fossilized tendril roots growing around the mountain’s edge

No one suggested steering the rover further into the valley.

No one wanted to *wake* whatever had left the truck there.

The rover sat for months.

Then came spring.

As the team prepared for Easter leave, they agreed to a new protocol.

“No more blind shutdowns.”

The lead systems engineer left EON-7b fully online. They activated continuous live-feed streaming and enabled motion-sensing alerts with real-time push notifications.

If the rover moved more than a few inches, every team member would get a text.

Then they went home.

They ate lamb and drank wine with their families.
They watched the news and pretended the world was still normal.

For two days, the rover remained still.

Then, at 3:41 AM UTC, the first motion alert fired.

Phones buzzed across all members of the project.
Red text. CAPS LOCK.

ROVER MOVEMENT DETECTED

Dozens of staff left during dinner with their families
Some left Easter parties at the bar - still drunk.
Others jumping out of bed, interrupting time with their significant others

Within fifty minutes, the entire lab was online.

And what they saw…

Was insane.

EON-7b was in motion.

Slowly, silently, but unmistakably moving on its own.

There was no AI input.
No navigation commands.
Something else was controlling it.

The camera feed showed jagged terrain passing underfoot as the rover descended the mountain, heading toward the fossil city.

As if something had *invited* it.

### III. Control Room Chaos

The lab went quiet.

Dozens of eyes stared at the feed as EON-7b crept its way down the mountain.

One of the senior engineers whispered:

“So, what do we do in this scenario?”

The room turned to the mission commander.

He hesitated. Swallowed.

“Uh… stop the rover.”

The lead systems engineer nodded, hands flying over the console.

He issued a shutdown command, standard sequence.

EON-7b’s feed went dark.

Completely.

No error code.

Returned with a successful shutdown confirmation.

The feed went black.

A moment passed when the commander issued the next step;

“Okay, can you bring it back online?”

The engineer ran the boot command.

Anticipation filled the room.

14 seconds passed.

31 seconds…

Then; the feed returned.

But something had changed.

The camera was no longer pointed at the descending valley.

Now it faced an open desert basin, an endless vast wasteland, flat and pale, with a singular lone structure within about 10 meters of the rover; a building the size of a small house, bulbous and organic in shape.

As the camera lens adjusted, the drone’s automated stillframe system captured an image.

In the frame, a tall, shadowy figure standing right infront of the building.

It had no distinct limbs, but suggestions of posture. Its mass swaying slightly, tapering into vague limbs. Its skin shimmered like chitin soaked in smoke. And as the feed focused… the figure melted into the structure, folding into its walls.

The control room exploded with chatter.

“Did you see that?!”


“Run it again! Enhance the frame!”

“It *moved*. That thing *moved.*”

The rover’s internal systems began pulling data on its own:

- **Thermal heat spike**, consistent with metabolically active organisms
- **Radiation bloom** at a frequency consistent with Slop residue
- **Biomass density** slightly lighter than average human mass
- **Movement speed**: 4.3 km/h — *walking*

The lead biologist squinted at the screen.

“That’s not a ghost.”

She pulled up the genetic index the AI had begun cross-referencing.

“It’s alive, there’s actually something there.”

There was a pause.

### IV. The Realization

They replayed the footage a dozen times.

Frame by frame. Pixel by pixel.

Each time, the shadowy figure was there… moving, reacting, disappearing into the organic structure like it belonged there.

But this time, no one joked about ghosts.

No one blamed a glitch.

Because the data was too clean.

The movement registered across every sensor: lidar, thermal, audio displacement, electrostatic drift.

It was clear this thing had been there with us the whole time.

---

Archive logs were pulled.

System glitches re-examined. The old motion alerts, the backup system pings, the strange EM pulses.

What had once been dismissed as environmental interference now formed a timeline.

- The first anomaly: 23.4 days after landing.
- The first EM echo: 27.1 days.
- The unexplained camera lens fogging: 31.6 days.
- The thermal bloom beneath the rover during week six.
- The big move over Christmas Holidays

It’s been with the rover this whole time.

Watching. Studying. Waiting.

A junior systems analyst ran a passive motion map based on old sensor drift logs. The results chilled the room:

The unknown figure had been within thirty meters of the rover on at least eight separate occasions over the last six or so months.

Now it made sense.

“It was curious.”

“We weren’t alone from the start.”

”It might be just as confused and afraid of our rover as we are of it.”

It was now a first contact event.

### V. The Unthinkable Coincidence

Every screen in the control center was alive with data, alarms softly blinking, comms chatter buzzing from translation relays.

The lead astrophysicist stared at the screen.

"Is this some survivor of this planet?"

the Lead Systems Engineer responds;

“Don’t let the pope find out, he will claim it’s Jesus or something”

They began cataloging everything:

- The temperature ranges the figure preferred
- The times it approached the rover
- The patterns in the EM pulses, now confirmed to be intentional, not language, not Morse, but structured curiosity

Someone in the linguistics team called it:

"A form of observational language."

---

Never before had humanity made contact with anything alien, and now they discovered two alien anomalies at once… one ancient and dead, and the other foreign and aware; both intertwined in the same moment, on the same cursed planet.

"We saw a fast meteor, we sent a rover, to simply discover more.
Then by dumb luck, we found a horrifically disfigured extinct world."
”We’ve been studying it for close to a year.”


"And this whole time something else has been studying *us*."
”We have no idea what it is. But we know it’s real.”

# Chapter 12 - The Impossible

### I. The Relay Horizon

Project Echofall was born ; an AI-navigated, magnetically-latched probe-rover hybrid, programmed to intercept the meteor, lock onto its surface, and deploy long-range autonomous scouts as it passed other systems.

Every year after the initial launch - Earth launched an additional assistant drone towards the trajectory of the Echofall probe. These complementary drones acted as network relays, boosting signal integrity across astronomical distances.

Humans weren’t expecting to find alien life with this mission. The goal was simply to *see more*:

“We’ll throw a seed at the stars. Let’s see what we discover.”

---

It is now **2532**. ****Nearly 19 years had passed since **2514** when ****the first network relay drone left Earth and landed on Nhexus in **2530**.

Unlike the meteor-bound Echofall, these relays were slow; optimized for endurance, not velocity. They coasted patiently, methodically, collecting passive data while strengthening the comms web.

Now, at the edge of its journey, the first relay drone approached a planetary system previously dismissed in initial scans of the Echofall rover as the meteor whizzed by it too fast to properly study its surroundings. But this slower relay drone detected it…

A dim, slow-burning star.

A world wrapped in deep cloud.

A planet unknown to humanity, but very familiar to something else.

Oc’Xari.

The drone registered only minor telemetry pings; no visible structures, no radio waves, just dense atmosphere and unexplained magnetic eddies.

But it lingered there.

Its AI directed it to perform a full orbital loop for better scanning angles.

On Earth, analysts noted the behavior; but found no cause for alarm.

Just atmospheric interference. Low-grade curiosity.

They didn’t know anything about this planet, they didn’t know the drone was being watched.

They didn’t know it had caught the attention of something *familiar*.

---

Back on Nhexus, the EON7-b rover continued collecting data.

More tissue samples. More resin fossils. More broken structures carved from pain.

And occasional shadows.

Once every few weeks, a glitch. A motion blur. A silhouette reflected in bone.

Each time, it caused a small eruption in the control center.

"We need a better lens."


"Did it move differently this time?"

"Was that a limb or a tool?"

But nothing ever resolved clearly.

### II. Eyes on Oc’Xari

The network drone’s systems were not designed for discovery.

They were meant to relay; to bounce, boost, and bridge signals across black space.

They carried no weaponry, no translators, no planetary descent packages.

But as the relay reached Oc’Xari’s orbital line, its sensors began to shift.

Something about the planet triggered its passive observational routines:

- Gravity fluctuations inconsistent with planetary mass alone
- Magnetic field pulses that resembled decaying logic circuits
- Static patterns in the clouds; too structured to be weather

The drone's AI logged the anomalies. It adjusted its camera arrays. It slowed its velocity.

---

Oc’Xari was a world of deep contrast.

From orbit, it appeared calm. A vast swirl of storm-draped continents and veiled oceans. No cities. No lights. No satellites.

But as the drone focused deeper; infrared, ultraviolet, EM resonance; it began detecting subtle irregularities:

- Infrared shadows that didn’t match surface heat
- EM patterns echoing across the planet in near-regular intervals
- Strange gaps in cloud cover forming and re-forming like optical camouflage

---

Then the drone’s directional array was hit by a soft pulse.

A signal of presence.

Its translation heuristic flagged it as structurally similar to the EM pulses observed from the entity back on Nhexus.

It transmitted the data back to Earth.

The science team stared at the signal logs.

One word began to circulate the lab:

"Same."

Whatever was watching the rover on Nhexus had the same signal data as what was being picked up on this planet.

### III. Puzzle Pieces

As the structured signal from Oc’Xari settled into the control logs, the room fell into rapid analysis.

A new thread of reasoning had begun to take shape.

One of the astrophysicists, reviewing trajectory archives, pulled up the original path of Project Echofall.

“Wait a second… the meteor Echofall hitched a ride on; it passed this planet. Oc’Xari was in the path.”

She overlaid the timeline.

The orbital proximity.

The delay.

And the realization hit the room like a silent detonation.

"That ghost entity isnt a native of Nhexus."


"They came from *here*. They saw our drone fly by and they followed us… but how?"

Echofall, in its slingshot arc, had unwittingly brushed past an ancient, dormant watcher world.

The thing watching the rover; the presence on Nhexus; had followed the probe’s path.

And now the gap made sense.

That delay; between when EON-7b landed and when the anomalies first appeared; it wasn’t confusion.

It was **travel time**.

“They needed time to arrive.”


“They followed us. Like barnacles on a ship.”

And so the math began.

The timeline cross-referenced.

The first signal echo from Nhexus logged precisely 23.4 days after landing.

Back-calculated, it logically aligned with Oc’Xari’s planetary distance and the likely trajectory of an autonomous watcher organism.

---

### IV. The Relay Path

Humanity's reaction was swift; but not loud.

There were no press releases. No public briefings, the close knit team did a good job at keeping the discoveries a secret.

Just data teams, code audits, signal triangulations.

The relay drone orbiting Oc’Xari became a full-time subject of study alongside Nhexus.

Its cameras were crude; meant to track stellar drift and cosmic microwave interference, not photograph planetary surfaces.

Still, the team fed its feed through every possible lens filter.

They tried to extract shapes, outlines, topographies.

But Oc’Xari remained obscured.

A planet hidden beneath haze, magnetism, and strange geometry.

![vrivon_cinematic_shot_of_futuristic_hightech_planetary_explorat_a487ef39-6e47-4c9c-b716-7a97d22b83b1.png](Chapter%2012%20-%20The%20Impossible/vrivon_cinematic_shot_of_futuristic_hightech_planetary_explorat_a487ef39-6e47-4c9c-b716-7a97d22b83b1.png)

---

Then, three and a half months later, something unprecedented happened.

The **next relay drone in line;** launched from Earth a year after the first; was still hundreds of millions of kilometers from Oc’Xari’s system.

But it picked up **the same signal**.

Identical pattern.

Same structural EM language.

Same subtle waveform layering.

"That doesn’t make sense," muttered a lead technician.


"It shouldn’t have the resolution or sensitivity to pick that up yet."

Nervous chatter swept through the comms room.

If the signal range was that large…

If the entity’s reach was that broad…

Was it extending toward them?

Or had it always been that large?

---

Two months later, the third relay drone picked up the same signal.

Over a billion kilometers away.

This time, the frequency contained minor alterations; a pulse shift, a new harmonic bloom.

The Earth team plotted the relay locations on a 3D galactic map.

They added the meteor path.

And the shape became clear.

A trail.

The same path *they* had launched along…

Was now being traced backward.

Every relay drone Earth had launched over the last ~18 years now served as a breadcrumb trail.

“It’s using our network as a guide.”

“It knows where we came from.”

The commander panicked and thought of a quick tactic 

“Uh… interfere the network relays target path, make them drift in completely different directions to try breaking up our trail”

The systems engineers were swift, and re-directed the navigation of the network relay drones to fly in an alternate directions, hoping it would confuse the entities and get them lost on the way to earth. 

… it was a good idea in the heat of the moment

# Chapter 13 - Hysteria

### I. Earthbound Shadows

Eight months had passed since the first glimpse of Oc’Xari during the Easter of **2531**. 

Since then, the signal had been picked up by seven of Earth’s relay drones.

Each farther away. Each carrying more clarity.

It seems, the Oc’Xari wasn’t phased by the drones re-routing their paths in a scattered motion, they had already calculated and figured out where Earth was… they were coming.

And now the second drone; hovering a modest distance behind the first; delivered the most shocking data yet.

A massive quantity of Oc’Xari entities.

Thermal shadows flickering just beyond optical range.

EM pulses pinging from multiple directions.

Biomass readings unlike anything seen before.

“They’ve calculated the path,” said the lead analyst.


“They knew exactly where our planet was once they saw our second network drone, they just looked back towards where we came and seen all out network relay drones.”

---

In the command center, tension reached critical mass.

The mission commander stood silent, arms crossed, staring at the wavefront of approaching signatures.

It was a hyper-scale invasion, unlike anything humanity has ever seen.

They were coming.

The commander spoke apathetically; 

“I’m proud of you all, and I’m sorry.”
“Notify global military agencies… the cat’s out of the bag.” he said quietly.

And with that…

the dam broke.

---

The first leaks came from internal channels.

Encrypted comms. Shared screenshots. Redacted coordinates.

It didn’t take long before the public caught wind.

And when they did

Chaos erupted.

Some believed it was a hoax.

Others saw it as divine prophecy.

Many fell into denial, clinging to the hope it was misunderstood.

But the patterns continued.

The drones continued pinging more signals.

It was undeniable now:

Something was coming.


Something alien.

Earth marked an X on their map.

Governments scrambled.

Religions split.

Militias formed.

"Prepare for first contact."


"Prepare for war."

"Prepare for the end."

Earth prepared for annihilation.

### II. Countdown to Arrival

As the Oc’Xari watchers continued their charge, analysts across Earth scrambled to measure their velocity.

And the numbers were worse than expected.

“They’re faster than the meteor.”


“Far faster.”

“Three years. Maybe less.”

What had once been a slow, creeping mystery became a sprint toward inevitability.

Earth had three years.

Three years to prepare.

Three years to defend.

Three years to survive.

---

Every major nation raised its taxes.

Drastically.

Funding diverted from civil infrastructure.

Budgets gutted from arts, education, and health.

Every spare ounce of GDP was channeled into military production, orbital defense networks, AI weapons design, and deep space tracking arrays.

Entire industries pivoted overnight.

Civilian companies became war contractors.

University labs were nationalized.

Governments established 24/7 readiness bunkers and blacksite command centers.

The world turtled in.

“They are coming. We have no choice but to give it everything we got.”

---

But not everyone agreed.

Mass protests ignited across the globe.

Millions believed the watchers were not enemies; but **visitors**.

They formed global peace coalitions.

They held signs with messages like:

- “WE ARE NOT AFRAID”
- “WELCOME THE STARS”
- “THEY COME TO SEE, NOT TO KILL”

Anti-protester groups formed in equal numbers.

Riots broke out.

Entire cities devolved into street wars between fear and hope.

Nations split ideologically.

Governments collapsed under pressure.

Militaries declared martial law in dozens of regions.

---

Crime exploded.

Faiths fractured.

Suicides spiked.

For every scientist studying the approaching anomaly, a thousand civilians whispered:

“They’ll wipe us out.”


“This is the Judgment.”

“We’re the next Nhexus.”

### III. Human Stories Beneath the Storm

The world spun forward in fear, but within its noise were millions of small, intimate lives, trying to make sense of an unraveling world.

### 1. **Nadine Keshet – Teacher, Samarkand**

Every morning, Nadine stood before her fourth-grade students trying to keep them focused.

She taught Earth science, but the curriculum hadn’t caught up.

But her students asked questions now:

“Will the aliens come to our house?”


“Do they know what cats are?”
”What kind of food do they eat?”

“Will they hurt us?”

And Nadine; calmly, gently; told them happy, joyful sci-fi stories.

She told them about space travel.

About stars.

About curiosity.

About beautiful and fun made up interstellar toys the kids would cheer in excitement for.

She never said the word *war*.

But she had a packed bag at home with a full fledged survival plan, just in case.

### 2. Dalton **“Stalwart” Bardwell – Former Maximum Security Prisoner, Detroit**

**Stalwart**, a 300 lbs genetically enhanced muscle man covered in tattoos had been out of prison for just seven months when the Oc’Xari signal hit the streets.

He worked nights at a scrapyard, traded cigarettes for breakfast, and tried to keep his name out of databases.

But the world didn’t care who he used to be.

It was falling apart too fast.

When the riots came, he was the first to stop a looter from smashing the corner store.

Not because he believed in peace.

But because the store owner was 81.

And that old man gave him bread once in a snowstorm.

Now Stalwart walked the neighborhood at night protecting family owned shops and innocent civilians from crime like a superhero. Fully plated in hyper-steel armor with AI-Implanted gadgets, armed with a military grade M4b8 modern high tech rifle.

Some called him a vigilante.

Some called him delusional.

But he called it paying rent.

“Looters, Gangsters, Aliens - Don’t matter, they gotta get through me.”

![daltonss.png](Chapter%2013%20-%20Hysteria/daltonss.png)

---

### 3. **Iseul Kim – Tattoo Artist, Daegu**

Business exploded when the signal reached South Korea.

People came from cities away to get inked with alien symbols, star charts, or imagined faces of the watchers.

One man came in and asked for a tattoo of the Nhexus pyramid fossil structure.

She asked him if he wanted something *that* ugly on his body.

He nodded.

“It’s real. It means we existed. It means we saw them.”

Iseul gave him the best work she’d ever done.

Not because she believed in it.

But because she wanted the watchers; if they ever looked at us, to see we marked our skin with what we feared most.

![u8296664269_Young_Chinese_woman_doing_tattoo_traditional_desi_6e9ce82e-2c46-4095-9631-8205efeaba01_1.png](Chapter%2013%20-%20Hysteria/u8296664269_Young_Chinese_woman_doing_tattoo_traditional_desi_6e9ce82e-2c46-4095-9631-8205efeaba01_1.png)

### **4. Master Lin Yusheng – Monk, Taishan Mountain, China**

The wind on Mount Taishan had changed.

It carried whispers now; fragments of radio chatter, tremors of satellites, the breathless panic of a world that had just discovered it was seen.

First, Nhexus. And now, an imminent invasion.

Master Lin had lived through war before. Not on the battlefield, but in the aftermath; mending limbs, boiling roots, praying for peace long after others had lost the will to ask for it.

But this was different.

The Earth shook in fear.

And Lin, high in his mountain temple, could feel it tremble beneath his sandals.

The university students from the village below brought him the news; first about the slop-creatures of Nhexus, then the sky-borne watchers of Oc’Xari.

They asked for his wisdom.

“Master Lin… if the heavens are just, how can they allow such beings to exist?”

He said nothing as he stared into the trees and listened for the wind's answer.

One student returned from the city, crying.

“They’re building weapons with AI that learns to kill faster. They’re calling them ‘preemptive gifts for the stars.’”

“Master Lin… are we going to kill them first?”

Lin simply asked:

“And if we do… what have we become?”

The global feeds filled with false prophets, collapsing governments, and new sects preaching surrender or sacrifice.

Lin watched none of them.

But every dawn, he made his tea, fed the crows, and swept the courtyard.

He could not stop the invasion.

He did not understand the slop planet.

But he did believe this:

“The sky has always watched us. Maybe now it is simply blinking.”

And whispered:

“Even if we die… let us die with honor.”

![u8296664269_taishan_mountain_china_monk_meditating_temple_che_23dcab8e-4abb-42b2-ac71-59d30d06d85f_0.png](Chapter%2013%20-%20Hysteria/u8296664269_taishan_mountain_china_monk_meditating_temple_che_23dcab8e-4abb-42b2-ac71-59d30d06d85f_0.png)

### 5. **Abhishek Bakshi – Underworld King Pin, Hyderabad**

In the chaos, opportunity blooms.

Abhishek Bakshi knew it better than anyone.
He ran data laundering, crypto markets, scam call centers, brokers for black-market neural mods and synthetic drug labs from the basements of a high-rise that pretended to be condemned.

Now, as the world fractured, his services were in higher demand than ever.

- Corporate executives paid to flee cities.
- Mercenary groups bought early access to private defense tech.
- Even minor governments funneled funds through his channels to bypass embargoes.
- Assortments of people ranging from low lifes to corporate executives buying drugs and body mod enhancements because “YOLO”

Bakshi didn’t care if the aliens came in peace or war.
He cared about margins.
And the margins were excellent.

He stared at the stars one night on a rooftop, a perfecto Nicaraguan cigar in one hand, sipping from a tumbler of fine single malt peated Islay scotch with notes of smoke, salt, toffee, oak and butter.

“They’ll come and go,” he said to no one, drawing in smoke from the cigar
“But I’ll own half this damn planet by the time they leave.”

![abhishek.jpg](Chapter%2013%20-%20Hysteria/abhishek.jpg)

### 6. **James Kokayko – Truck Driver, Whitehorse, Yukon**

James Kokayko had been driving the Alaska Highway for twenty-three years.

He knew every pothole, every frost heave, he knew all the local moose, buffalo, and grizzly bears by name at this point.

"There's old Nancy crossing the road with Jim again..." He'd say to the pair of wolves that crossed the highway near Carmacks, Yukon.

His rig was a 2518 Kenworth T880 with a custom sleeper cab, heated floors, and Starlink satellite.

He hauled everything: mining equipment, fuel drums, frozen goods, construction materials for remote communities.

The highway was his office. The radio was his companion.

When the news broke about the Oc'Xari, James was somewhere between Teslin and Watson Lake, hauling a load of prefab housing panels to a settlement near the border.

He heard it on the CB first.

"You hear about the aliens, Kokayko?"

"Yeah, I heard. Probably just government propaganda. They do shit like this before every election. The news gets crazier each year."

But the chatter didn't stop.

Every trucker on the highway was talking about it.

Some were scared. Some were excited. Some were making jokes.

James just kept driving.

He had a schedule to keep. A family to feed. A mortgage on a little cabin in Whitehorse.

Aliens or no aliens, the world still needed supplies.

---

But as the weeks went on, things got stranger.

The highway traffic thinned out. Fewer trucks. Fewer cars.

Some communities stopped ordering shipments altogether.

Others stockpiled like it was the end of the world.

James kept driving.

One night, parked at a rest stop near Liard Hot Springs, he sat in his cab eating canned chili and watching the northern lights dance across the sky.

They were brighter than usual. More active.

He'd seen the aurora a thousand times, but this felt different.

The colors moved in patterns that didn't seem random.

Swirls. Pulses. Almost like… communication.

He shook his head, laughed at himself.

"You're losin' it, buddy."

But then his radio crackled.

Not the CB. The AM/FM.

Static. Then a voice.

Not English. Not any language he recognized.

Just… sound. Rhythmic. Melodic. Almost like singing.

He turned the dial. Every station was the same.

He shut it off.

Sat in silence.

---

When he got back to Whitehorse, the town was different.

People were hoarding. Fighting. Praying.

His wife met him at the door, tears in her eyes.

"James, they're saying the aliens are coming. They're saying it's real."

He held her.

"I know, people are going absolutely nuts."

"What do we do?"

He looked out the window at the mountains, the forests, the endless sky.

"If aliens wanted us dead, we would be dead already. So if they're real, we'll be fine."

He kept driving. Kept hauling. Kept the supply lines open when others gave up.

He became a lifeline for remote communities that had been cut off by panic and fear.

People started calling him "The Last Trucker."

And if the world was ending, James Kokayko figured he might as well go down doing what he loved.

Driving. Alone. Under the northern lights.

### 7. **Dallas Red – The Wranglin’ Cowboy, Saskatchewan Prairies**

From a townless countryside farm in Saskatchewan Canada

Dallas Red didn’t own a smartphone.
He didn’t own a TV.
He lived like it was 1955; because, in his mind, the modern world hadn’t produced much worth keeping.

He heard about the aliens the same way he heard about last year’s drought:
Over coffee at the co-op, between stories about flat tires and fence repairs.

He didn’t believe it.
Not really.

“Aliens? Sure. And next you’ll tell me they pay taxes.”

But when the people in his town started panicking; packing up, breaking down, turning on each other; Dallas saw what mattered.

He didn’t buy the hysteria.
But if folks needed something steady to lean on, he’d be that.

Aliens were coming.
The world was breaking.
Cities were full of fire, riots, chaos.

So Dallas did what he always did:
He opened the barn doors.

Over the following months, his ranch became a makeshift sanctuary.
He didn’t hang signs.
Didn’t post to the net.

People just came from word of mouth.

He converted the hayloft into sleeping quarters with wool blankets and cedar planks.
Cleared out two old storage sheds, outfitting them with salvaged cots and propane heaters.
Built a communal firepit in the pasture where the fence had long since collapsed.

Families from Calgary, Regina, Saskatoon, even Winnipeg found their way there.
Seventeen households in total plus a few other individual scragglers.

He converted the hayloft into sleeping quarters.
Cleared out old storage sheds to house the displaced families.
Used spare tractor parts and rusty extension cords to wire a backup generator from an ancient windmill.
Hauled buckets of well water every morning.
But the most important thing he did?
He stayed calm.
He just rolled his sleeves up, passed around mason jars of moonshine, and played lazy old guitar riffs by the fire. 

In his kitchen, he’d have blues playing on the music box with the window open so you could hear it from the deck outside while they barbecued. He taught all his guests how to farm, proper ways of tending to animals, and other farm chores. Pretty soon, he had trained a whole self-sustaining community.

He sat with the kids and told tall tales about sasquatch and ghost coyotes.
He played poker with the dads.
He taught the moms how to fix a carburetor with a spoon.

And his slow-draw, good-natured attitude became the emotional spine of the place.

He just nodded once and said:

“Ain’t no point in dying scared if you can live brave.”

By month three, most of them didn’t talk about aliens anymore.

They just called it "Red’s Ranch."

And a few even started saying what Dallas said from the beginning:

“It’s probably just a government hoax anyway, this will all blow over and we’ll return to normal life again.”

# Chapter 14 - A Visitor

### I. The Hour of Arrival

**2535**

Three years passed.

Every satellite had tracked their approach.

Nhexus exploration project has been completely halted, with full attention directed towards the invasion. 

Every sensor had screamed the same truth.

The Oc’Xari swarm, what had once been a handful of curious watchers had grown into a cloud of movement so dense it dwarfed anything the solar system had ever seen.

Each one a living enigma of alien motion, folding through magnetic wakes and dark matter tethers.

And now, they had just passed Mars.

Projected arrival to Earth’s orbit: One hour.

There was an eerie global stillness.

The calm before the unknown.


The hush before the first real contact.

Skies were clear. Cities were still.

Every military weapon pointed at the sky.

![491839707_122240936246031351_313570662912448627_n.jpg](Chapter%2014%20-%20A%20Visitor/491839707_122240936246031351_313570662912448627_n.jpg)

People stood on rooftops, beaches, deserts, ruins.

Waiting.

Except in Saskatchewan.

At Dallas Red’s ranch, the fire pit crackled.

Kids laughed around hay bales.

An old cassette deck played blues rock through a speaker duct-taped to a wheelbarrow. The song skipped and fuzzed for a few beats.

Nobody looked up.

“That’s just the satellites acting weird again,” one man said, tipping back a mason jar of ol’ bathtub whiskey.

Dallas strummed his guitar; an off-tune, soulful waltz.

The kids clapped.

The moms sang along.

No one packed a bag.

No one loaded a weapon.

---

### II. Arrival in Silence

An hour passed.

Then another half hour.

The world, so long frenzied, now held its breath too long.

In every command center, bunker, radio tower and emergency broadcast station… nothing moved.

Eyes locked to the sky.

To screens.

To silence.

Where were they?

Had they stopped?

Changed course?

Turned back?

“They should be here.”


“They *are* here.”

“So where the hell are they?”

---

Then maybe about 20 minutes later… it happened.

At exactly 5:42 p.m. UTC, a massive shadow rolled across the sky.

It didn’t come with noise.

Or fire.

Or fury.

Just a slow, oppressive dimming; 

As if a gigantic, silent hand passed between Earth and the sun.

Birds fell quiet.

Winds stopped.

For about ten seconds, the world was bathed in an unnatural gray haze.

And then… it faded. It was gone.

The sun returned.

The clouds were normal.

Birds began chirping away.

It was like nothing happened?

---

Military bases scrambled.

Ground radars spun wildly.

Comms channels buzzed like beehives without queens.

“Did anyone see anything?”


“Was it just a cloudbank?”

“Are they cloaked?”

“Are they *gone*?”

The Echofall control center went into red lockdown.

All systems reported the same thing:

THEY ARE HERE.

But nobody could see them.

Satellites shrieked with error flags.

Thermal arrays lit up like Christmas grids.

Quantum-lattice scanners showed distortions in every atmospheric layer.

And the AI defense systems?

They were screaming.

“Presence detected in all hemispheres.”


“Spatial irregularities exceed prediction models.”

“Oc’Xari biomass signature confirmed; surrounding all major landmasses.”

Monitoring systems were detecting and reporting hundreds of thousands of detected entities within our atmosphere, littering the entire planet.

But to the human eye?

Nothing.

No ships.

No shapes.

No voices.

Just a world like it was before.

---

What Earth didn’t know; 

The Oc’Xari had melted into the biosphere.

Blending seamlessly into wind patterns, soil frequencies, tree-root EM lattices.

Merging with data cables.

Slipping into memory.

And now…

They were everywhere.

Watching.

And Earth had no idea…

### IV. Return to Normal?

A month passed.

And slowly; painfully; the world began to normalize.

The skies were still blue.

Cities buzzed again.

Phones chirped with gossip instead of evacuation warnings.

The Oc’Xari were nowhere.

At least, not visibly.

Not audibly.

No ships. No weapons. No signs.

So people did what humans always do when the unexplainable overstays its welcome:

They forgot.

---

Governments began to crumble under scrutiny.

Whistleblowers leaked classified recordings.

Budget sheets emerged.

The global taxation spikes? The mass mobilization? The emergency powers granted to world leaders?

All of it had been exploited.

All the events in the last couple decades including the Echofall Project - was labeled as a fake hoax, setup as a narrative to control people, tax the hell out of the planet and test human behavior reactions under a possible alien invasion as if it was a fire drill.

Oligarchs expanded their holdings.

Defense contractors posted record profits.

Some cities never received the defense infrastructure they were promised.

The trials began.

Rioters jailed.

Politicians interrogated.

The public turned vicious.

And at the center of the fury was the **Echofall commander**.

“You lied.”


“You panicked the world for funding.”

“There were no aliens.”

His team; once composed of the world’s best minds; now found themselves banished from networks.

Their credentials questioned.

Their findings labeled as AI-induced hallucinations causing mass hysteria.

---

The AI Defense Systems still alarming and generating thousands of alerts a minute about foreign entities detected all over earth were shut off.

Dismissed as faulty.

“They’re broken.”


“They’re still pinging ghosts.”

“It’s a software bug.”

The engineers protested.

The scientists screamed.

They poured over their equations, rewrote their models, reverse-engineered signal profiles.

But their voices were drowned out by laughter.

By dismissals.

By normalcy.

---

And no one…

No one asked about Nhexus.

The EON-7b Echofall rover?

Still active.

Still sending data.

Fossils of ancient life. Flesh Buildings. Bone Pyramids. Alien Entity Shadows.

But nobody cared anymore, the network feeds were buried.

The servers were now maintained by interns who didn’t even know what the project was.

Most of the public now believed it was all fake. The meteor, the rover, Nhexus and the invasion.

It had become a myth.

A punchline.

"Aliens? Like the Slop Planet? Please."

# Chapter 15 - Life After Chaos

---

### 1. **Nadine Keshet – Teacher, Samarkand (Post-Arrival)**

Three months after the sky dimmed, the Uzbekistan Ministry of Education invested in updated science textbooks.

They were heavier. Glossy. Expensive.

Inside: nothing about Nhexus. Nothing about Oc’Xari. Just diagrams of mitochondria and happy cartoon planets.

Nadine’s classroom had changed.

The kids didn’t ask about aliens anymore.

They asked about volcanoes, and why Saturn has rings.

But sometimes… they asked weirder things.

“Ms. Nadine, do animals have feelings like us?”


“What’s the difference between pretend and real if they both feel true?”

“Is memory a kind of dream we all agree on?”

She tried her best to answer.

But more and more, Nadine found herself telling stories instead.

Not facts. Not lessons.

Just stories.

Like the one about the invisible creatures who watched the world for years but never hurt anyone.

Or the one about the city in the sky, made of bones that grew in perfect circles, where everything was made wrong; but still wanted to be loved.

Her students always listened.

And once, a quiet girl in the front row whispered after class:

“If they’re still watching… I hope they think we’re nice.”

Every so often, a student would be seen off in a far side of the playground, seemingly talking and playing with an imaginary friend… such students would often experience changes in their personality, not bad changes… just different. 
Their encounters would be shrugged off as “they’re just kids, growing and finding themselves”

---

### 2. **Dalton “Stalwart” Bardwell – Detroit (Post-Arrival)**

Dalton went viral, the Mayor of Detroit handed him a Hero award. He was gifted a beautiful house on the lakeside, and granted him a universal basic income so he may live out a financially stable life.

He was recognized and celebrated, and a statue was built after him downtown. 

The riots stopped. The military pulled back. Grocery stores reopened.

Still… He did his nightly rounds.

Still wore his plated vest, kept the M4b8 loaded and close.

But he wasn’t fighting many crimes anymore, he was mostly doing community chores. Volunteering at the food bank, cleaning up garbage, helping school kids cross the street.

He helped folks fix stuff; gutters, generators, old drones turned into food delivery services.

The streets called him “Uncle Stalwart” now.

He pretended to hate it. But, he would blush inside.

Every now and then, someone; usually drunk; would mutter at the fire barrel of a shifty ghetto pub:

“Hey, remember that time the aliens didn’t kill us?”

And everyone would laugh like it was a joke they all agreed to forget.

Stalwart didn’t laugh.

Even without aliens, he fought an insane magnitude of urban civil wars and street crime. His 3 years as a vigilante was far from trauma-free. 

In the following months, Dalton received a particular distress call from Law Enforcement to check on a young girl claiming she was hiding under the dining room table from robbers in the house. When Dalton arrived on the property, he did a tactical sweep of the exterior of the house. There were no signs of entry, nobody was there… when the young girl let Dalton inside the home, the first thing he noticed was all the kitchen counters, cabinets and appliances were bolted upside down to the ceiling… It was this moment Dalton knew, regardless of what the masses believed, the aliens were in fact here.

### 3. Iseul Kim **– Tattoo Artist, Daegu (Post-Arrival)**

Business slowed after the Arrival.

No more people rushing in with wild ideas about alien script or Nhexus tower etchings.

Now it was back to tigers, koi fish, and roses.

Still, Iseul left the Slop mural on her shop’s back wall.

Twelve feet tall. Inked in brushstrokes of mud and blood-tone reds.

A tower of malformed faces rising into smoke.

Some customers looked at it and said:

“That’s ugly. Why don’t you paint over it?”

Iseul never answered.

She just maintained her equipment and let them talk.

One quiet night, Iseul was conducting general housekeeping of her shop, when she heard the door open with the chimes ringing, she said a half ‘Welcome-’ pausing mid word when she saw there was nobody there, and the door was still closed.

She packed up, closed the store for the day and went home.

---

### **4. Master Lin Yusheng – Monk, Taishan Mountain, China (Post-Arrival)**

The wind on Mount Taishan had changed.

It no longer carried the rustle of old forest or the chatter of sparrows alone. Now it brought fragments; whispers from the valley below. Satellite signals. Panic turned into static. A world trying to forget what it had seen.

Master Lin’s students brought him updates: headlines printed in haste, half-burnt clippings of leaders resigning, scientists dismissed, AI logs declared corrupt. They laid them at the steps of the meditation hall like offerings.

“Master,” one asked, “if they truly came, why did nothing happen?”


“Were they not gods? Or monsters? Why leave us untouched?”

Lin swept the stone floor without looking up.

“Perhaps not everything that touches us leaves a mark we can see,” he replied.

Some monks left the temple after that. Not out of fear; but restlessness. The silence of inaction had become unbearable to them. They sought answers in cities, in new temples, in strange beliefs springing up like weeds in a shaken world.

Lin remained, tending the tea garden. Repairing broken roof tiles. Lit incense for no one in particular.

The following week, plum blossoms had begun to bloom along the courtyard wall. Rain came lightly in the mornings; cleansing, not cold.

One such morning, Master Lin sat beneath the veranda, pouring tea from a clay pot worn smooth by time and steam.

He felt a door near him gently open, but nobody emerged.

That’s when he noticed the plum blossom petals.

They had fallen across the stone in an impossible pattern; *not random* as nature would allow, but arranged. Curved. Layered. Like art drawn in breath.

He did not disturb them.

He bowed his head slightly, and said aloud, though no one else was near:

“Ancestor, spirit, or star-walker;


If you carry memory across skies,

Then honor the virtue of restraint.

Harmony is not in power. It is in understanding.”
…
“The rites say a noble guest arrives without pride,

leaves with grace,

and listens longer than they speak.

If you are here,

then may you find what you seek.”

A breeze stirred.

The petals scattered in silence; every last one. 

The courtyard grew still.

And just as Lin turned his gaze toward the tea again; he saw it.

A shadow, humanoid figure, dark as soot, stepped into view. It crossed the stone courtyard soundlessly and opened one of the old wooden temple doors.

The door creaked slightly… then clicked shut behind it.

Lin did not follow.

He only poured the second cup.

And, eyes resting gently on the threshold, as he breathed out, he said once more:

“May you find what you seek, traveler.”

The wind carried the scent of plum blossoms through the temple for the rest of the day.

### 5. **Abhishek Bakshi – Underworld Broker, Hyderabad (Post-Arrival)**

The panic economy was gone.

Defense contracts dried up.

Crypto tanks.

Biohack mods outlawed again.

Abhishek adapted. He always did.

But business didn’t matter anymore.

He'd made enough to buy his way into any place, any identity.

And yet, he stayed.

Same building. Same office. Same broken chair with the red tape on the armrest.

He watched the news from seven countries at once.

Monitored the encrypted forums still whispering about *them*.

He noticed the trend no one else seemed to care about:

Memory inconsistencies. AI hallucinations mimicking watcher shapes.


Infrastructure behaving like it was… being observed.

Abhishek didn’t believe the watchers had left.

He would notice weird blips and bugs in his computers - ones that never happened before, and ones that were unexplainable, his security cameras would constantly alert him for motion triggers, and he’d check them to see nothing… he knew the aliens were here.

He believed they were *still collecting data*. Still watching through the systems they’d merged with.

And so he left messages for them.

In plain text, on notes on his front door, and buried in code.

Etched into packet delays.

A single phrase, over and over:

“I got connections, if you need any answers, or want to do business… I’m your guy.”

He figured if they ever needed a broker…

He’d be the first name on their list.

### 6. **James Kokayko – Truck Driver, Whitehorse, Yukon (Post-Arrival)**

The highway was normal again.

Traffic picked back up. Supply chains stabilized. The panic faded.

James was back to his regular routes: Whitehorse to Watson Lake, Watson Lake to Fort Nelson, Fort Nelson to Dawson Creek, back up to Dawson City. Same ol' roads.

The northern lights still danced. The mountains still loomed. The forests still stretched endlessly.

---

One night, parked at the same rest stop near Liard Hot Springs, James stepped out of his cab to stretch his legs.

The air was cold. Crisp. The stars were impossibly bright.

He walked to the edge of the parking lot, looking out at the dark forest.

And then he saw it.

A shape. Humanoid. Standing just beyond the tree line.

Not moving. Not threatening.

Just… there.

James froze.

His hand went to the tire iron in his belt.

But he didn't pull it.

He just stood there, staring.

The shape didn't move.

And then, slowly, it raised one arm.

Not in aggression. Not in warning.

Just… acknowledgment.

Like a wave.

James, after a long pause, raised his hand back.

They stood there for a moment, two figures in the dark, separated by a hundred feet and a billion years of evolution, waving at each other.

And then the shape turned and walked back into the forest.

James watched it go.

He didn't tell anyone.

Didn't report it.

But he pulled out a pen and notepad and wrote down a name - "Cordelle" - "That's your new name buddy, maybe I'll see you around more often."

James got back in his cab, and he had a schedule to keep.

---

### 7. **Dallas Red – Saskatchewan Prairies (Post-Arrival)**

The last pickup truck kicked up a cloud of dust as it rolled down the dirt road, a trail of kids waving out the back, cheeks sticky with honeyed bannock and sunburned laughter, one last joking consensus amongst the folks heading home about the whole alien thing was a big government hoax.

The barn had been a church for strangers, a shelter, a place to pretend the world wasn’t falling apart. Now it was just a barn again, smelling like cedar, hay, and spent lantern oil.

Dallas Red stood alone.

Chewing a long, dry piece of hay. Humming some old Hank Williams riff to himself as he stacked the last few bales in a tidy little corner.

The wind creaked the boards.

The barn settled like it was exhaling.

He scratched the back of his neck, reached for the rake, and mumbled:

“Well… that’s that, then.”

He’d miss the noise, if he was honest. The kids. The makeshift moonshine choir. The woman who patched that old goat’s leg like it was her own. He started talking to himself;

“They'd promised they’d be back next year. ‘Alien Day at Red’s Ranch’ they called it. Big laughs. Barbecue and disbelief.”

“Gonna be a damn civic holiday soon,” he’d joked back to himself.

But the party was over now.

Dallas turned to close the barn door, he closed the latch on it just to keep the wind from blowing it open. He turned around, picked up a bucket, carried it over to the far corner of the barn, put it in it’s place along with some other tools; and that’s when the barn door swung open.

A gust of cold air rolled in.

He didn’t even flinch. Dallas got excited thinking one of his guests came back for something. So he turns around squinted into the light and said:

“Well now, did you forget something, or”

He froze.

The hay dropped from his mouth.

His hands went slack by his sides.

Standing in the doorway; perfectly still, framed in golden prairie dusk; was something the world had claimed didn’t exist.

It wasn’t mist or shadow or EM blur.

It was there.

Oc’Xari.

Fully revealed. Shaped into a humanoid-like form.

A figure of geometry, matte crystal and folded symmetry; its edges breathing like lungs made of lattice.

Where arms might be, there was motion; flowing extensions that shimmered like smoke trapped in bone. One of them reached forward, longer than any human limb, impossibly slow and certain.

In its grasp?

Dallas’s guitar.

His old acoustic. The same one he'd strummed every night by the fire, calloused fingers plucking chords he'd never learned to read, just knew.

Only now, it wasn’t the same.

The body of the guitar was engraved; etched in microscopic perfection. Galaxies. Coordinates. Pulsar trails. Gravitational whirlpools. Unknown constellations. A map of the stars; not as we see them, but as *they* know them.

A small, ethereal hovering device, the size of a shotgun shell; floating half an inch above the sound hole of the guitar.

It spun in slow, weightless rotation.

Light shimmered through it in colors Dallas didn’t have words for; tones of blue that looked like ice crying, violets that smelled like lightning.

Tiny glyphs rippled across the surface.

At the bottom right of the body of the guitar, in silver script, engraved so fine it glowed against the woodgrain:

“Alien Day at Red’s Ranch”

Dallas didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Didn’t breathe, maybe.

Then, finally, like gravity snapped back into place, he took a half-step forward.

His boots crunched the straw.

He looked up into the shifting symmetry of the entity, eyes wide, and said:

“Well I’ll be a six-legged donkey.”

The Oc’Xari didn’t answer.

It just stood there, silently holding out the guitar like it was something sacred.

What Dallas didn’t know; what no one on Earth could’ve guessed; was that the entire Oc’Xari consensus was all watching him in deep focus.

He never flinched, begged, feared or believed.

He simply lived, and calmly helped his fellow neighbors.

And in doing so, he became more alien to them than anything.

They were intrigued.

They wanted to understand.

And so now, in the quiet of a lonely barn in Saskatchewan, the first proper contact began.

Not with the government.

Not with a space battle.

But with a man looking at a guitar etched with an alien map of the entire galaxy, and an ancient alien life from far far away, leaning in with anticipation. 

---

### V. Dallas Red – *The First Note*

The barn was still. The sunlight through the wooden slats was golden and soft. Dust hung, refusing to settle.

And still the Oc’Xari waited, arm outstretched, holding the star-etched guitar as if it’s the most important object in the universe.

Dallas’s throat clicked, dry like a man who just swallowed lightning.

He wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans. Looked at the entity, then looked at the guitar.

He tried to speak; nothing came out.

Then, like someone hit a dusty jukebox in his chest, a breath rattled out:

“…I guess you wanna hear how this thing sounds, huh?”

No answer, of course.

Just the infinite patience of something that had never known time as a burden.

Dallas turned around. Walked three steps across the hay-streaked floor. Pulled a metal bucket from under the wall shelf.

He flipped it upside down with a clang.

Sat down slow.

Cracked his knuckles.

Took the guitar; like it was a pawn shop $5 special, and not the most valuable artifact in the galaxy; accidentally banging it off on one of the wooden support beams of the barn as he swung it up into his lap-”Whoops”

Plucked one string.

The sound it made wasn’t music.

It was the sound of honey turning to crystal under moonlight. The sound of mountain snow on Everest. The sound of a warm kitchen on Christmas Eve.

He took about a minute tuning it by ear like he’d done a thousand times.

Looked over at the alien, nodded once.

And then, quietly:

“Wrote this one for my wife. She passed a while ago. Never did sing it for anyone but her…”

He strummed and sang a slow, lonesome country melody; sweet and cracked like dry maple bark in spring. The words were simple. About love at the edge of a prairie, about holding hands through hard winters, about promises made around firepits when the world felt like it might end.

His voice was rough.

Honest.

Human.

---

### VI. The Best Song in the Universe

But the guitar… wasn’t normal.

The moment he played the first full chord

It began to broadcast.

It amplified through the rafters of that dusty barn, shot through the hayfields, bounced from grain silos, and into the very crust of the Earth.

And then through every radio tower on the planet.

Every car stereo.

The refugees from Dallas’ Ranch recognized his voice and turned the music up.

Abhishek’s crypto mining computers froze up to play his song

Dalton’s M4b8 high tech rifle started playing music

Every emergency comm array, home speaker, television, museum audio guide, smartwatch, cellphone, tablet, walkie-talkie, and forgotten Bluetooth speaker under a couch in Nebraska.

People on subway platforms in Bangkok heard it through PA systems.

Soldiers in bunkers on front lines of conflicts thought someone was playing a prank.

Pilots flying over Greenland went silent in their cockpits.

Astronauts aboard the International Orbital Dome wept to the beauty of the music.

And out in space, every single relay drone from the Echofall network. From the farthest to the first, lit up. All at once.

They echoed the song outward; playing it through micro-transceivers, grav-laced amplifiers, and deep-space quantum lattices.

And finally on Nhexus

The EON-7b rover stirred.

Its speakers crackled to life.

In the middle of a wasteland of the dead slop planet of bone, among the fossils of nightmares, and beneath a sky where nothing should sing- blared the speakers of the rover, singing a slow, human song drifting like a campfire memory.

And every UN-DSDA control room on Earth fell into silence.

Every technician froze.

Every scientist stared.

The commander, sitting in the middle of a courtroom, across from a federal judge and his lawyer, felt his phone buzz in his jacket pocket.

He looked down.

Lead Systems Engineer: [Call Incoming]

He picked it up with trembling hands.

“Do you hear the song?” the engineer whispered, voice cracked with disbelief.

The commander paused.

From the courtroom speakers; Dallas’s voice was singing.

The room was silent and confused.

Everyone listened.

The commander closed his eyes.

Leaned back.

Swallowed.

And said:

“…Yeah.”

# Chapter 16 - It Was All A Dream

### I. A Kickin’ Wranglin’ Cowboy

Going back to Dallas on the bucket, he had just finished his song, with no idea that it was projecting across the planet and beyond.

He looked up at the alien.

The Oc’Xari did something strange; an advanced signal completely foreign to human understanding. But somehow, Dallas knew exactly what it meant. It was a cheer of approval. A silent, resonant kind of joy. The alien was pleased.

With a sudden gust of wind, the barn door swung shut; not slamming, but gently closing itself as if with care.

The Oc’Xari was gone.

Dallas stood up slowly.

Turned around.

And blinked.

The bucket he had been sitting on was already back on the shelf he had taken it from.

But that wasn’t all.

The entire rear portion of the barn; where he’d had his back turned; had changed. It still had the same country-western soul, the same rust-stained charm… but now it was *refined*. Reinforced.

The old wood was replaced with rich, varnished grain. The hinges on the tools gleamed; in silver, some in gold. The walls held strong, fine steel bracing between them. Everything was improved; but nothing felt out of place. It still felt like *his* barn.

He gasped.

Turned toward the front door again.

And now the *entire* barn was like that; quietly, lovingly renovated. No noise. No fuss.

Dallas rubbed the back of his neck, wide-eyed, then chuckled.

“Now that’s what I call an alien invasion.”

He didn’t care much for material things; but this? This felt like a thank-you.

He strolled out of the barn, calm and whistling.

His fields were mowed. His old, beat-up house looked just like it did when he first had it built; nothing modern or flashy; just… restored. The wood looked cleaner. The porch straighter. The paint just a bit more vivid in the late sun. And in the driveway glistened a brand new 1950s Ford F1 pickup truck (keep in mind the year is about 2535), Dallas spent some time appreciating the renovations, the hard yard work, and the truck that shouldn’t exist in this year… He sat in the truck, opened the glovebox, the truck was actually insured to a man named “James Bethoz.” It was a collector vehicle stolen by the aliens from a billionaires garage, and relocated to Dallas Red’s driveway.

“Heh, and the news said we should be scared of aliens… I suppose I should cover the truck with a tarp incase someone comes looking for it.” 

He covered the truck and he spent the rest of the day pondering it all.

The encounter.

The alien.

The guitar.

The free renovations.

The truck.

He sat at his kitchen table, gently cradling the engraved guitar in his lap. The markings along the wood; the map; made no damn sense to him. Looked like a child’s doodles mixed with the circuits from a super ai computer.

And then there was the floating thing above the strings.

It wasn’t solid.

More like a shimmer; a projection hanging in the air, flickering like oil in moonlight.

Every time he brought his hand near it, it would respond; humming, pulsing, alive.

And when he finally touched it? It was like he turned on a projector.

The walls lit up; beams of light displaying screens like in Ironman sprawled across his appliances, painting strange glyphs and alien interfaces in every direction. It was like a spaceship had unfolded into his house.

He quickly panic reacted.

“Oh shit; how do I turn this off?!”

And the moment he *thought* it; the projections vanished.

Just gone.

Silence again.

Later, when he wanted music, the shimmer would play it for him; somehow knowing just the tune he wanted. When he went to clean his stove, the shimmer pulsed and emitted a ray of soft light that instantly cleaned the surface spotless.

It didn’t ask permission.

It just *helped*.

And Dallas?

Dallas just sat there, guitar across his knee, staring at the thing in amused disbelief.

“Well… I’ll be a six-legged donkey.” - he chuckled again

He wasn’t scared.

He was a bit confused. But he just grinned.

And poured himself a drink.

---

### II. The Dream at the Chuckwagon Café

Dallas finished his dinner with a slow chew, wiping the last of his beans with a heel of sourdough. On the kitchen table beside him sat a local newspaper, folded to a story about the Commander; headline circled in red ink:

"Echofall Commander Faces Final Hearing Amid Accusations of Mass Global Scale Fraud, Delusion and Conspiracy."

Dallas scratched his chin, took a long sip of water, and glanced at the photo.

“Aren’t you in a mess…” he muttered. “I’d buy you a drink if I ever met ya.”

He folded the paper with a sigh, cleared his plate, padded over to bed, and fell sound asleep.

The guitar leaned against the corner wall, glowing softly in the dim light.

---

**The dream came fast. Too vivid to question.**

He was sitting at a worn bar counter inside the Chuckwagon Café; a dusty saloon in Diamond Valley, Alberta, a place he’s never been in before, but a place he totally digs.

The light was warm and gold. The air smelled of sawdust, burnt sugar, and pine smoke. 

Dallas leaned forward, pressed the little brass bell on the bar top with the back of his knuckle.

Ding.

The kitchen service door behind the bar swung open; softly, smoothly.

Out walked the Oc’Xari.

Same one from the barn. Silent. Serene. Still faceless, but no longer unknowable. This time it wore a long apron dusted with flour and soot, moving with practiced grace. In three elongated arms it carried three glasses of moonshine, perfectly clear and glowing faintly like bottled lightning.

Dallas raised a brow.

“Three? Little much for just me, ain’t it?”

The Oc’Xari said nothing.

It floated one glass toward Dallas.

Another to the man now seated beside him; a soldier, his silhouette sharpened by age and weight. Steel-grey hair. Rough, unkempt, sleepless, stressed. Eyes that have seen horror darker than any mortal man. A soul that has hurt, more than any could bare. Slouched on the chair.

The Commander.

The same one from the newspaper.

Before either could speak, the Oc’Xari pressed play on an old jukebox.

Dallas’ song. The one he played in the barn. The one the whole world heard, once.

It spilled into the saloon like syrupy light; golden and slow, rich and haunting, like honey on pancakes, and holy water through cathedral bells.

The three raised their glasses instinctively.

Clink.

They drank.

And then they danced.

The Oc’Xari; learned to line dance quick as it stood beside Dallas, as he laughed loud, stomping the floorboards to the beat of the blues. Dallas yelled;

“What’s your shoe size?” he said through a wheeze. “We gotta get you a pair of cowboy boots.”

In the logic of dreams, the Commander suddenly found himself holding a pair of boots.

He hesitated; utterly baffled at the absurdity of what was happening. He looked around as if trying to find the hidden camera, the rational thread, the part where someone explains *why* he’s fitting an alien with *cowhide footwear* in a saloon he’d never seen before.

“Am I on one of those reality prank TV shows?” he muttered to no one.

Still, he knelt down and helped the Oc’Xari slide in.

No one spoke.

But everyone understood.

The saloon glowed with laughter and warmth. The alien never said a word. Didn’t need to.

It was home here.

And then; like all fever dreams do; it changed.

They were outside.

In the wide, open prairie of Dallas’ ranch, the sky soft and blushed with twilight.

And in every direction…

Thousands of Oc’Xari dancing, like it was a music festival in California.

All wearing cowboy hats, bolo ties and boots.

The kids back from the refugee camp were there in the dream too that night - playing with a six legged donkey. 

All dancing, drinking moonshine, sitting around campfires, barbecuing ribs and brisket, helping with an assortment of chores around the farm.

It was so gloriously, stupidly, impossibly beautiful that the Commander whispered aloud:

“This is the dumbest, most incredible moment of my life.”

And he meant it.

![u8296664269_combine_chuckwagon_cafe_with_a_western_saloon_sty_da4bc943-352b-4282-8261-6a0ca32386e7_2.png](Chapter%2016%20-%20It%20Was%20All%20A%20Dream/u8296664269_combine_chuckwagon_cafe_with_a_western_saloon_sty_da4bc943-352b-4282-8261-6a0ca32386e7_2.png)

---

**Dallas woke up.**

Sunlight leaked in through the windows like spilled whiskey.

He sat up slowly from his bed, blinking through haze and confusion.

The guitar glowed.

Brighter than before.

And above the strings hovered a projected message, swirling in soft light:

"Location Saved: Chuckwagon Café, Diamond Valley AB


**Time: 4:00 PM | Date: One week from today."**

Dallas stared.

Then noticed the same message, handwritten in his own crooked scrawl, pinned to the fridge with a cracked horseshoe magnet.

He chuckled.

“Guess I already knew.”

He underlined the date twice and stuck the note back with a gentle tap.

“Wouldn’t wanna be late.”

---

### III. Meanwhile, in Fort Campbell, Tennessee…

The Commander shot up in bed like a man struck by lightning.

Sweat glued his undershirt to his chest. His heartbeat echoed like a drumline.

His TV was on.

The screen glowed soft blue static, with no signal and no source, and in the center:

CHUCKWAGON CAFÉ – DIAMOND VALLEY AB


**TIME: 4:00 PM – ONE WEEK FROM TODAY**

He blinked once.

Twice.

Then rubbed his face like he was trying to wake up a second time.

“The *what* cafe-*where*?”

He didn’t recognize the bar or the town.

Didn’t know the man with the guitar.

He didn’t even see the Oc’Xari clearly in his dream.

But he remembered the song.

The same song that once blared through every communication system on Earth.

The same song that interrupted a court hearing meant to dismantle his career.

The same song that blared away on the haunted dead slop wastelands of Nhexus 

He sat at the edge of the bed, elbows on knees, eyes locked to the screen.

“This is insane.”

He shook his head.

And started searching for flights to Calgary, Alberta - he booked his flight about a week in advance - exactly 6 days from now, so he can land a day early to get there on time the next day. He’s never been to Calgary, so he needed the time to get situated. 

---

### IV. The Fallout

That morning, the commander made breakfast for his wife and kids, who worried for him dearly as he left his house living his last day as a free man; or close enough to it.

The dream still clung to him in phantom warmth: the Chuckwagon Café, the clink of glasses, that damn line-dancing alien in size 45 boots. The music. The light. The impossible calm.

But Earth didn’t run on dreams.

Earth ran on paperwork.

And today… his name was on every form that mattered.

He arrived at the courtroom in a sharp, perfect suit, and a face that hadn’t slept.

The courtroom was quiet, heavy with that familiar tension; half legal process, half public theater.

The Commander sat at the defense table, hands folded, expression unreadable. His lawyer, a wiry woman with steel in her spine; adjusted her glasses and leaned into the mic.

Defense: "We submit, once again, that the data presented during the Echofall mission was interpreted in good faith, with real-time decision-making under extraordinary circumstances"


Prosecutor (cutting in): “Good faith doesn’t explain falsified threat assessments, overspending on defense infrastructure, or activating global alert protocols without verifiable evidence of a threat.”

Defense: “Verifiable to whom? The data remains intact with clear evidence.”

Judge: “Let’s not repeat the last two weeks, Counselor. We are here to determine responsibility for mass panic, misuse of international scientific resources, and global psychological harm. Stick to what’s new.”

The prosecutor turned to the Commander.

Prosecutor: “Do you deny that under your authority, your team escalated an ambiguous extraterrestrial signal into a planetary emergency?”


Commander: (quietly) “No.”

Prosecutor: “Do you regret the global consequences of that decision?”

Commander: (pausing, choosing) “…I regret that the world shut out real evidence when the truth got inconvenient.”

Murmurs in the gallery.

The judge banged her gavel once.

Judge: “That’s enough. Mr. Commander, you’ve been under conditional release pending resolution of these hearings. Do you have any further requests at this time?”

The Commander stood slowly. His lawyer shot him a glance; unsure. He took a breath.

Commander: “Yes, Your Honor. I’d like to request temporary leave from state jurisdiction.”

Judge: “For what purpose?”

Commander: “A funeral. Family friends. Calgary, Alberta.”

A pause.

The judge arched a brow. Looked down at the file.

Judge: “You’re asking to leave the country in the middle of your own trial?”

Commander: (steady) “I’ll be back in three days. No longer.”

Prosecutor: “We object; this feels unwise given the gravity of”

Judge: (holding up a hand) “Three days. No extensions. You may leave at the end of this week. Return by the third sunrise after or you forfeit bail and face immediate incarceration. Understood?”

The Commander nodded once.

Commander: “Understood, Your Honor.”

The gavel struck again.

And with that, the path to Diamond Valley… was officially open.

---

After the morning trial, he went down to the science space center to his cubicle, as he attempted to login to the computer - it showed an error ‘Account Locked’

About an hour later, the head of HR came by with a manila envelope, slid it across his desk.

He hadn’t opened it right away.

After some time of staring at it, clicking his pen, he let’s out a sigh and finally, he opened it.

Inside:

- Termination papers
- A severance check
- And for the first time since the trial began; his full name, printed cold and clean:

Zhang, Haoyu – Clearance Revoked


Effective Immediately

He stared at it a while. No emotion on his face. Then folded the letter in half once… then again… and slid it beneath the coaster on his desk like it didn’t matter.

Because maybe it didn’t.

Everyone who touched the Echofall project; every engineer, advisor, and analyst; either:

- Laid off quietly
- Transferred to unrelated departments
- Or threatened outright

“If you speak to the press, the board, or each other about the project; you’re done.”


“This is national stability, not science.”

“You want your pension? You will probably have to server some jail time for media publicity… Just swallow your pride, get it over with and keep your mouth shut.”

It wasn’t even subtle.

By noon, the juniors; fresh-faced interns and grad students; were assigned new instructions.

They were ordered to begin dismantling the network:

- Wipe the rover’s uplink logs.
- Shut down the Echofall comms server.
- Archive everything into encrypted cold storage.
- Power down the last monitoring relay on Nhexus.

“Pretend it never happened.”


“Back to normal.”

The press was merciless.

The public had moved on.

No one wanted to hear about slop, ghost signals, rover visions, or invisible alien cowboys.

And for the first time - A rover… an advanced piece of human technology from Earth lays disconnected on another world. Left to rot like the planet it was left on.

---

The commander sat on a concrete bench across from the federal building, envelope still in hand, tie half-removed, depression in his eyes.

The dream still lingered in his bones.

He looked down at his phone. The glowing message from the TV; now burned into his retinas; was still sitting in his Notes app.

CHUCKWAGON CAFÉ – DIAMOND VALLEY AB


*TIME: 4:00 PM – ONE WEEK FROM TODAY*

He pulled out a cigarette.

Lit it with trembling fingers.

Took one long drag.

Then whispered, to no one in particular:

“If I’m gonna get arrested for something… might as well be for showing up to a bar in Alberta and having a drink with a cowboy and an alien.”

He flicked the ash.

And started planning his trip.

---

### V. The Return Home

His key turned in the lock at 2:32 PM.

The house greeted him with still air and stale silence. His boots hit the hardwood with the same rhythm they had for years, but now it felt like walking into someone else’s life.

There was no smell of dinner.

No warm music in the kitchen.

Just a stack of overdue letters on the credenza and a magnet note from his youngest:

“Science fair soon! 🧪 :)”

He sighed. Rubbed his brow.

Set his jacket on the hook like it still meant something.

He sat down in an old couch in the living room which he bought when he first purchased the house over a decade ago. It was the longest he’s ever sat in that couch since. Haoyu sat in silence, listening to the clicking of a clock on the wall. 

Thinking back to everything - from the meteor, to Nhexus, to the alien planet of Oc’Xari, to the invasion clouds, the riots and wars that broke out on Earth over it, and the dream from last night.

A couple hours later, the door opened.

His wife came in; eyes tired but alert. She looked at him, read the room instantly.

No hug. No words.

Just a long glance.

Then the sound of school backpacks and shuffling feet.

His two kids; the son, barely ten, and the daughter is 6; walked in behind her, arguing about a vending machine.

They saw him.

Paused.

The little one said, gently:

“Hi, Baba.”

He smiled, best he could.

“Hey, kiddo.”

And that was that.

### VI. Dinner, in Truth

Within less than an hour, the table was set with care, even if it wasn’t said aloud.

- A platter of hong shao rou, the pork belly cooked the night before - glistening with deep caramelized glaze.
- Steamed pork buns, delicate, with ginger and scallion oil spooned over the top.
- A side of garlic stir-fried choy sum still sizzling in the ceramic.
- Warm rice bowls. A half-poured pot of jasmine tea.

Haoyu Zhang sat down last.

He hadn’t spoken much since coming home.

The silence of the family was heavier than the food.

He took a bite. Chewed. Swallowed.

“I might need to go up north,” he said.

His wife paused in mid-sip.

“Work?”

He glanced at her. The corners of his mouth twitched into the ghost of a smile.

“Something like that.”

A beat of silence.

He set his chopsticks down.

“Well… now my clearance is revoked,” he said, voice almost amused. “I guess I don’t have to keep secrets anymore.”

She looked up slowly.

“What secrets?”

He exhaled hard through his nose. Leaned back in his chair. Then spoke.

And rambled.

He told her everything he had to keep a secret from even his own family over the past decade.

Echofall.

The meteor.

Nhexus. The fossil city. The pyramid.

The screaming silence.

The genetic match.

Oc’Xari. The shadows. The anomaly. The watcher.

The way the world pretended to forget. The way they punished him for remembering.

She didn’t interrupt once.

Not during the part about the rover.

Not when he mentioned that the creature had touched it.

Not even when he said; “we’re not alone, and we never were.”

Then he paused.

Lifted his tea cup.

Drank.

Set it down.

“Remember that weird country song that played on the radio all over the world?”

She responds… “Yeah that was really weird, and people have been talking about it all over social media…” 

He followed up;
“Well, last night, I had a dream.”

He described the saloon.

Chuckwagon Café.

“I was sitting beside this old cowboy

This alien thing that I’ve never seen before, pours us moonshine 

Then it starts singing that song from the radio, and before we knew it, we were partying with aliens

Then I woke up - and the TV was on, displaying an address of the saloon and a time stamp”

She blinked.

“You think it was real? Did you hallucinate it onto the TV?”

He looked at her.

Eyes worn from courtrooms, years of silence, and a world that stopped believing in wonder.

“Before Nhexus? I’d have said I was losing my mind.”

He paused.

“But after seeing a pyramid made of alien spines… and seeing rover footage of an entity from another planet standing in the fog of a dead world”

Another breath.

“I don’t think ‘real’ means what it used to.”

She looked down. Quietly pushed a few grains of rice around her bowl.

Then she looked up.

Softly.

“So… what happens next?”

He didn’t know.

But he found himself smiling; just barely.

“I think I’m going to Alberta.”

And she didn’t laugh.

She just nodded.

Then reached for the tea, poured them both a cup, and said:

“You’ll need a warm coat. I read once that Canada still freezes in the spring.”

### VII. Lights Out

Later that night, the hallway lights were off.

The house had gone quiet, save for the soft hum of the heater pushing warm air into the corners of the room. From outside, the Tennessee winds whispered through the pine.

Haoyu sat on the edge of the bed, half-undressed, rolling his socks off one foot at a time. His wife stood at the bathroom sink, brushing her hair in the dim glow.

They didn’t talk much. But not because there was nothing to say.

They’d already said it.

When she came back into the bedroom, she found him lying back against the pillows, one hand resting on his chest, the other loosely clutching the old newspaper clipping he’d circled; the one with his own face, half-shadowed under the words *Mass Fraud* and *Delusion*.

She slid under the blanket next to him. For a moment, they just listened to each other breathe.

Then, softly:

“You sure it was a cowboy?” she asked, a small smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.

He smirked through his nose.

“Boots. Hat. Accent like he invented the word ‘reckon.’ Yeah, it was a cowboy.”

She chuckled.

“So, what… this cowboy and an alien walk into a bar…”

He turned his head toward her.

“You’re mocking interstellar prophecy now?”

She raised an eyebrow. “Something like that.”

Haoyu responded “I think we have another prophecy we need to fulfill” 

A soft click sounded as he reached across and turned off the bedside lamp.

More details don’t need to be said, if you know, you know what happened next.

Once all was said and done, they fell asleep.

# Chapter 17 - The Homeworld

---

### I. Dream of the Witness World

Haoyu wasn’t sure when he had fallen asleep.

One minute, he was lying in bed beside his wife, her breathing soft and steady beside him. The next; silence. A silence so deep it felt like the world itself had stopped moving.

He opened his eyes.

And the sky… wasn’t sky.

Above him stretched a dome of fractured, glimmering lattice; crystalline strands laced across a dark, mineral ceiling, like someone had frozen lightning in obsidian. It shifted subtly, refracting faint pulses of violet and rust-orange light, blinking in rhythm like the heart of some vast, slumbering intelligence.

The ground beneath him crunched like powdered slate. Every footfall hummed faintly, the planet conducting sound into something deeper than echo; a kind of memory. The air was breathable, but dry, like breathing inside a cathedral built from metal and bone.

He was standing on Oc’Xari.

He didn’t know how.

But somehow… he *knew*.

“This is it,” he whispered, voice soft, hoarse with disbelief. “This is their world.”

His boots crunched across a path of hexagonal basalt plates, each one etched faintly with impossible angles. He squatted down, brushed his fingers over a groove. It vibrated a subtle hum under his touch.

---

That’s when he heard it.

Faint at first. A low, rumbling engine hum.

Internal combustion?

His ears couldn’t trust it; but his instincts did. The sound grew louder. Mechanical. Familiar. Ridiculous.

Then, from the blur of heat mirage ahead, a shape emerged.

An old 1950 Ford F1 pickup.

Two-tone, Red paint with Cream Trim. Chrome grill. Whitewall tires.

The sound got louder. The engine sputtered. The truck groaned forward, wheels grinding over crystal-like sediment with no concern for physics.

And then it parked; ten feet in front of him.

The driver’s door creaked open.

A boot dropped to the ground.

Out stepped Dallas Red; wearing faded jeans, a wide-brimmed cowboy hat, a wrinkled denim shirt with the sleeves rolled up like he was prepping for a livestock auction.

He didn’t look surprised to be here.

He looked annoyed, like he’s already been here for a long time, and he didn’t really like it.

Dallas tilted his hat back, squinted at Haoyu, and spoke like it was just another Tuesday:

“You just gonna stand there gawkin’… or you gonna help me pump my gas tank?”

Haoyu blinked, unsure whether to speak, laugh, or run.

He turned his head slowly to the truck.

Then to the rear fender.

There it was. The gas cap.

Still sealed and waiting to get pumped.

And then; behind him, as if it had always been there; a gas station.

Not futuristic. Not alien. A dusty, one-pump outpost straight off Route 66 highway in Arizona with cracked red signage and faded paint. The price tags on the board were unreadable; alien symbols instead of numbers, flickering slightly as if written in thoughts instead of ink.

Haoyu took a long breath, eyes narrowing at the surrealism of it all.

He looked back at Dallas

Dallas was chewing on a piece of hay.

“Well?” Dallas said, rattling the drivers door handle with impatience. “You ain't gonna leave a cowboy stranded on a planet made outta brain rock, are ya? I don’t have a credit card, and this station don’t take cash.”

Haoyu rubbed the bridge of his nose.

“Jesus Christ…”

“Jesus ain’t gonna pump that gas for you” replied Dallas

In disbelief, Haoyu reached for his wallet, put his American Express card into the slot, it accepted his pin… he sighed - “what grade of gas does this truck take?”

“Premium for this baby” said Dallas

Haoyu presses the premium gas - unsure how much it costs as it’s displayed in some strange alien symbolic text. 

Once the tank was full, they both got in the truck, as Dallas drove.

---

As they crested a ridge, Haoyu’s breath caught in his throat.

The world below unfolded like a cosmic wound carved into geology.

A valley stretched beneath them; so vast it felt like they were driving along the inner rim of a planet-sized cathedral.

- Ribbons of mineral lattice, arranged in recursive spirals, shimmered like liquid circuitry.
- Some sort of river flowing with what looked like liquified gemstones
- Spines of crystalline arches jutted from the ground, humming with low, mournful resonance.
- Massive stone teeth shaped towers of gemstones wound upward like frozen tornadoes, each embedded with fractal veins that pulsed with silent thought.
- Floating above the chasm, weightless and slow, were watcher orbs; not flying, not hovering, but being; their motion like thoughts suspended in space.

The sky was glimmering with crystalline aurora-like residue of neural computation. Shapes flickered across it; too quick to track, too deliberate to be random. Equations. Memories. Echoes.

![doctor.s2025_A_surreal_landscape_with_floating_crystal_mountain_5d90116b-d28f-4b11-ae35-a48cb32e473a.png](Chapter%2017%20-%20The%20Homeworld/doctor.s2025_A_surreal_landscape_with_floating_crystal_mountain_5d90116b-d28f-4b11-ae35-a48cb32e473a.png)

Haoyu stared, slack-jawed, struggling to form words as the truck rattled down a slope carved from petrified thought.

Finally, he managed to ask:

“Where… where are we going?”

Dallas leaned forward slightly, eyes on the winding path ahead. He gave a little shrug.

“We’re going to the saloon.”

Then he nodded toward the valley.

“It’s down in there.”

Haoyu blinked. The words made no sense at first; until they did.

His heart caught in his chest.

“The… Saloon?”

“Mmhmm. I need a drink”. Dallas replied.

Haoyu perplexed…

They drove in silence for another minute, the road beneath them turning more uneven, more wild. The truck’s suspension began to groan as the path narrowed, sloped, and buckled.

Eventually, Dallas tapped the brakes and pulled the old Ford to a halt at the foot of a ragged incline. Ahead, the terrain turned jagged; narrow passes, crystalline overhangs, and veins of gemstone threading through the rock like frozen fire.

“She don’t go much farther,” Dallas said, patting the dashboard like it was a tired mule. “We walk from here.”

They stepped out of the cab and were immediately surrounded by silence. The ground sparkled beneath their feet, a narrow trail of crushed gemstone gravel winding through towering formations.

Haoyu followed, boots crunching over paths carved through walls of colossal jewels; monolithic spires of ruby, sapphire, emerald, and stone he couldn’t name. The gems seemed to hum as they passed, casting shifting light across their faces like passing thoughts.

Some of the formations were jagged, natural.

Others looked deliberately constructed; arches shaped like tuning forks, stair-like indentations in walls with no stairs, spirals that climbed nowhere but seemed to observe.

![ChatGPT Image May 12, 2025, 10_26_14 AM.png](Chapter%2017%20-%20The%20Homeworld/ChatGPT_Image_May_12_2025_10_26_14_AM.png)

Haoyu kept walking, heart thudding in his chest, unsure if he was on a hike or a pilgrimage.

The air was cool and clear, but it felt charged. Every breath felt intentional.

Twenty minutes passed in dreamlike silence.

Then, without warning, the narrow pass opened up.

And there it was.

Standing calmly at the edge of the crystal corridor

The Chuckwagon Café.

Exactly as it had appeared in his prior dream.

- Timber-framed, lantern-lit, windows fogged by old laughter.
- Faded paint, rusty hinges, a horse post in front even though no horses were here.
- A chalkboard leaned on its side, the words *“Taco Night 2-for-1”* faintly visible under dust and strange alien glyphs.

Haoyu stopped cold.

His eyes slowly drifted *beyond* the saloon.

And there, behind it; stretching from horizon to horizon; was a vast, flat expanse of mirrored terrain.

It looked like an ocean….

Strange shadows drifted across its surface, like shadows drifting in the winds of Kansas corn fields.

Haoyu stepped forward, heart frozen in awe. The silence deepened.

He looked up at the sky.

The stars glimmered, one of them Earth, one of them Nhexus…

He turned back towards the saloon.

Dallas stood there, leaning on the hitching post, chewing on that same piece of hay. Then walked through the saloon doors, the wooden frame creaking softly behind him. They swung closed with a gentle thud.

Haoyu stood alone outside a moment longer.

The vast mirrored terrain behind the saloon stretched endlessly ; flat, surreal, and silent. 

He approached the saloon, turned and pushed open the door.

Inside ; no Dallas.

The room was dimly lit by old hanging lanterns, their glow too steady to be fire, too warm to be mechanical. Dust hung motionless in the air.

Haoyu’s eyes locked on a large big screen TV mounted above the bar.

It was the news.

Footage from earlier that day ; his own trial. There he was: fresh suit, eyes sunken, shoulders drawn. The footage showed the courtroom, the judge, the moment he asked for temporary leave. The dialogue played exactly as he remembered it. Every inflection. Every breath.

Then he noticed them.

Standing and sitting silently around the TV; a crowd of shadowy figures.

Watchers.

Oc’Xari.

Each one motionless, their forms cloaked in darkness, height shifting subtly like oil moving underwater. No faces. No limbs. But aware.

They all turned; together; to look directly at him.

The air vanished from the room.

Haoyu’s chest seized. He froze.

The figures did not move. Did not speak.

They simply watched.

Stared.

Through him.

Around him.

Into him.

It was too much.

Too silent.

Too *real*.

And then

He woke up.

Lying flat in bed, drenched in sweat.

Heart pounding.

Breath ragged.

His wife stirred beside him, half asleep.

The room was quiet.

The TV was off.

And the lingering pressure in his chest, like the weight of a hundred invisible eyes that hadn’t yet looked away.

# Chapter 18 - Laid to Rest

### I. The Echofall Project - Neglected and Forgotten

**The UN-DSDA Control Center, outside Fort Campbell TN**

The server room was quiet now.

No hum of processors.

No blinking lights.

No alert pings chirping in red across dim screens.

Just dust.

The Echofall control center; once the crown jewel of Earth’s deep-space observational infrastructure; was now abandoned. The desks had been cleared. The wall-sized projection displays unbolted and carted off. The chairs, tagged for auction, were stacked awkwardly in a corner behind crates of fiber cabling no one bothered to inventory.

Once, this room had broadcasted the impossible; images of an alien world, a planet of bones and towers made of flesh, the first whispers of proof that humanity was not alone. A whole team had lived in this room; slept in shifts, ate in the hallway, argued over readings, whispered theories behind cups of black coffee and cold dinner rolls.

Now?

Just emptiness.

Nhexus; the name barely meant anything to the interns now assigned to rewire the control center for general use. One of them, bored, asked an older engineer about it during a lunch break.

“Wasn’t that the Slop Planet thing?”

The engineer just shrugged.

“Old probe. Some kind of AI generated hoax. Whole thing got shut down. Don’t worry about it.”

The servers that once monitored the quantum entanglement compression feeds were dismantled.

The network relay drones; over a dozen of them; now floated aimlessly in deep space, offline, unpinged, no longer tracked.

And the EON-7b rover?

Still sitting there.

On a cracked, alien plateau.

Pointed toward a half-buried fossil of some grotesque structure no one remembered anymore. 

The rover became just another fossil added to the collection of forgotten things on the dead planet.

In the corner of the darkened room, high on the wall, a faded whiteboard still bore the outline of the original project title in red marker:

ECHOFALL

No one erased it.

No one cared.

![controlroom.png](Chapter%2018%20-%20Laid%20to%20Rest/controlroom.png)

For the commander… more legal arguments at the court, Haoyu and his lawyer trying to provide evidence which was all being wiped from datacenters as they speak. 

The courts, media and press didn’t care about evidence. They just needed someone to blame for everything, and they’ll cover it all up if that’s what it took.

It became evident, Haoyu was facing a significant prison sentence. The public needed someone to be brought to justice.

Instead of politicians and corporate CEOs taking accountability- it was all blamed on the commander.

Haoyu had many more stressful, quiet, awkward interactions with his wife and kids, and had a hard time getting any sleep at night.

# Chapter 19 - Forgotten

### I. The Walk Through the Womb of Error

Haoyu was finally asleep, and back in dreamland.

He simply was; standing still, as if he’d been there for hours already.

Before him loomed the infamous Ossari Pyramid; the one he had studied through filtered sensor feeds and rover cameras in the sterile labs of UN-DSDA.

Now it towered above him.

It was taller than he imagined. Wider. And far more *intimate* in its horror.

Haoyu took a step forward.

The terrain beneath his boots yielded with a soft squelch, the topsoil like dried gelatin over wet sponge. 

The silence of the forgotten world was oppressive. 

He wandered, tracing the base of the pyramid. Here he found the Spine-Lanterns, collapsed like broken chandeliers, their ribs burst open, glowing cores fossilized to a faint iridescence.

He passed what he thought was a tree; until he realized it was a fused bundle of reversed-root Lurch-Buds, their root-children calcified mid-birth. Their outer tissue looked like bark, but inside the petrified plants were *faces*, sealed shut in fetal agony.

He turned and saw more:

- Tongue Tracks in the ground; paths made by creatures dragging themselves across the dirt with muscular taste buds.
- An overturned transport vehicle, unmistakably made from biological material; spinal column frame, limb-wheels, hardened skin stretched taut across the hood.
- A wall made of Ossari skulls, every one cracked open like eggshells, brain-puddles long since dried into brittle crystal veins.

Haoyu walked on, wordless.

It wasn’t just the *wrongness* of it all that sat in his chest.

It was the sadness.

The tragedy of it.

Every species that lived here; every *thing;* had tried. It had suffered. It had adapted in desperation, deformed itself into failure, mistake after mistake, and still, *it tried*.

He knelt beside what had once been a Slop nesting dome; vomit-layered walls hardened into a shell of chemical bile. Inside, fossilized offspring like jellied marbles sat fused together in a pile of frozen filth. Their eyes had no lids. Just exposed globs, pointed *inward*.

Haoyu shivered.

“Even in death… they never found peace,” he murmured aloud.

![480984217_122228753672031351_2201485459986581057_n.jpg](Chapter%2019%20-%20Forgotten/480984217_122228753672031351_2201485459986581057_n.jpg)

### II. Liminal Spaces

Above him, the sky was the same permanent gray it always had been.

No clouds. No moon. Just the faint brownish orange glow of a dying sun trying to burn through the upper ammonia layers.

He looked up at that sun.

And a second sorrow struck him; this place is utterly, completely forgotten.

Back on Earth, the control center that once monitored this landscape had been dismantled.

The relay drones were now offline, floating useless hunks of titanium and electronics through the endless vacuum of space.

The rover that had once stood in this very valley was probably still pointing at some incomprehensible structure.

Nhexus had been buried by time, bureaucracy, and shame.

A miracle of cosmological rarity; *the single worst biological mistake in the known universe…* and humanity had decided it wasn’t worth the embarrassment.

They had unplugged it, labelled it as fake, ignored it, neglected it.

Forgotten it.

Moved on.

Haoyu placed his hand upon a fossilized flesh wall.

And in that moment, he mourned it.

Because it had suffered…

…and no one came to say goodbye.

Haoyu had lost track of time; if time even existed here.

He had walked for what felt like hours, maybe days, through the urban sprawl behind the pyramid.

This wasn’t visible to the rover; no one back on Earth had seen this.

The rover had only scanned the outskirts, only glimpsed the valley’s edge.

But here, in this forgotten corridor of the Slop planet, there were cities.

Flesh-built skyscrapers, rising like tumors of bone and tendon, webbed together with fossilized sinew and cartilage, there were bridges on the 5th, 6th and 7th floors connecting the skyscrapers - the bridges looked like one of those ant bridges you see in jungles in documentaries.

Each building different; one narrow and twisting like a severed intestine spire, another wide and hunched like a corpse trying to stand.

The "windows" were made of skin stretched out so thin that you could sort of see through them.

The balconies? Rows of ossified fingers or massive rib cages.

![481217559_122228753750031351_2515079089565637785_n.jpg](Chapter%2019%20-%20Forgotten/481217559_122228753750031351_2515079089565637785_n.jpg)

Haoyu passed one tower that had grown into itself; its top bent backward, re-absorbing the base through a collapsed archway of ribs.

The roads were made of spine segments, vertebrae aligned perfectly like bricks, polished smooth by the ancient air.

And still, the deeper he went, the quieter it got.

Just the echoes of his footsteps.

And yet; couldn’t shake the feeling.

The endless liminal spaces. The sensation.

The one that creeps in when you’re *truly alone*, and know you’re alone…

But some primal shard of your brain insists:

You’re being watched.

The kind of feeling that isn’t fear, exactly; just a subtle tightening in the chest, a static behind the ears, a vague pressure in the air like someone’s gaze is pressing against the back of your neck.

But he wasn’t being watched.

There was no movement.

No figures in the windows.

No flickers behind the shadows.

It was just residual instinct.

A leftover response in a man raised in a world where silence rarely meant safety.

But here, on Nhexus

It was just silence.

True silence.

And it was unsettling.

![u8296664269_liminal_spaces_buildings_made_of_bone_vast_street_f11317b7-22d8-48da-9fb9-f737c9ccd4af_0.png](Chapter%2019%20-%20Forgotten/u8296664269_liminal_spaces_buildings_made_of_bone_vast_street_f11317b7-22d8-48da-9fb9-f737c9ccd4af_0.png)

---

Eventually, he turned a corner; one massive, bloated building had blocked his view until he reached the end of the street.

And then he saw it.

He froze.

There it was.

The Chuckwagon Café.

Unchanged.

Exactly as it had been in his prior two dreams. The old wood exterior. The painted sign hanging by a crooked nail. The cracked neon “OPEN” light buzzing faintly, despite having no power source.

- A chalkboard leaned on its side, the words *“$10 baby back ribs!”* faintly visible under the haze of the ancient sun.

And standing at the front door; boots up on the railing, straw hat tipped low over his eyes was Dallas Red.

He looked up as if he’d been expecting him for hours.

Gave a small nod.

Then, with a wry grin, said:

“You comin’ in for a drink, cowboy?”

Haoyu didn’t answer at first.

His mind was still processing the impossibility of it all.

This building.

On this planet.

Surrounded by structures built from failure and agony…

And here was Dallas, like nothing was wrong.

Like the whole damn thing made sense.

Haoyu took one step forward.

Then he nodded slowly.

“Yeah… I think I’ll order an Old Fashioned.”

He stepped forward toward the warped saloon door, each step crunching softly across the fossil-dust underfoot. Dallas, leaning lazily against the doorframe with his usual calm, gave a knowing nod and said:

“You go first, so I don’t somehow lose you like I did last time.”

It was a strange thing to say, but Haoyu found comfort in it.

Because last time; on that glimmering crystalline plain; when Dallas went into the saloon… Dallas just disappeared, and the inside of the cafe was scary… and unsettling.

But this time, with that cowboy drawl still fresh in the air, he felt a thread of assurance that maybe… maybe he wouldn’t be alone in this next dream-space.

He reached for the handle.

Turned it.

Opened the door.

---

### III. You Gotta Try The Rib Special!

The instant the saloon opened before him, the comfort evaporated. A wave of wet rot slapped him in the face; thick, mucosal, reeking of spoiled organs and something worse.

It wasn’t the Chuckwagon Café anymore. Not even close.

It was Nhexus.

Alive.

The floor had collapsed into a muck-swamp basin, churning with viscous sludge. The liquid surface convulsed with the movement of half-born things; blubbery, translucent growths twitching and pulsing as if trying to scream through unformed mouths.

Fused into the interior saloon walls were flesh-twisted creatures; no longer dead, no longer fossilized. Their bodies had become part of the architecture itself. One had dozens of arms, all sprouting from a swollen torso, reaching and grasping for nothing. Another had teeth along its spine, grinding against the timber support beam as if chewing through its own back.

From the ceiling, a pale creature hung upside down, tethered by intestines, its face *peeling*, mouth opening and closing in slow, broken sobs. Its eyes were misplaced; some inside its cheeks, others sealed shut with skin grown over them.

The air was alive with sounds:

- Gurgles.
- Wet gasps.
- Screeching moans.
- High-pitched whimpers.

And then, at the far end of what used to be the bar, stood a massive beast… this beast was somehow different from everything else on Nhexus. It was unique. An anomaly.

A mutated pig-thing, nearly seven feet tall at the shoulder, its hide patchy with leaking sores, its lower jaw hanging like melted rubber, twitching with malformed fangs. One eye stared, too large, too wet, too human. The other socket had no eye at all, just a raw hole pulsing with red meat and twitching nerves.

It was looking straight at Haoyu… Haoyu felt an overwhelming evil presence pulsating from the entity.

A moment passed.

And Haoyu finally turned to check behind him; looking for Dallas, for the door, for any glimpse of comfort.

But Dallas was gone.

So was the saloon door, and the saloon was also gone from the fever dream.

Suddenly he stood right at the rovers initial landing site - at the foot of the monolithic pyramid, alive and looming. Its surface wasn’t stone anymore; it was raw, fleshy, pulsating with slow contractions, like a sleeping heart that had never stopped beating. From its base oozed a thick black syrup that hissed when it touched the ground, giving off a stench like burnt fat and grave mold. Sounds of painful wailing and agony screams howled away by the tens of thousands.

Then, the ground liquefied beneath his feet.

Spongey terrain gave way to sludge, creeping up his boots. It sucked at his ankles. It was warm. It moved on its own.

From within it rose insects; but not like any he’d ever seen.

- Translucent with hollow abdomens filled with writhing black threads.
- Backs lined with molar-like teeth, chewing silently.
- Mouths in their legs, gnawing at his pants.
- Some had tiny human fingers where antennae should be.

They began crawling up his legs in waves; hundreds of them, biting, grasping, tasting.

Haoyu opened his mouth to scream.

And he woke up.

---

Bolted upright in bed, gasping, soaked in sweat, heartbeat hammering like a deathmetal bass drum in his chest.

The air was still.

His breathing ragged.

That nightmare had felt more real than anything in the waking world.

Because the world he saw; the Slop Planet alive; wasn't a vision of a myth or a dream.

It was a memory.

Something had happened there. 

And now it was in his mind.

For a moment, he forgot where he was.

The hotel room was unfamiliar; clean, bland, beige with sterile framed prints of prairies and pine trees. It took a beat before he remembered: Calgary.

He checked the clock.

1:04 PM.

“Shit.”

His flight had landed the day before, after a terse customs check and one last signature at the parole office. He'd checked into the hotel late, eyes still red from five straight nights of courtroom stress and sleep-deprived fever dreams.

But today wasn’t a day for hesitating.

This was the day.

The seventh day.

The day from the dream.

Meetup at 4:00 PM.

He had three hours.

---

He moved fast.

Threw on his shirt. Slipped into a blazer. Shaved just enough to not look homeless. Splash of cold water. A protein bar in his mouth. No time for real food.

The hallway was quiet. Elevator ride silent.

He ran down the block to a car rental enterprise, filled out the paperwork, paid. The clerk didn’t look twice at his ID, guess they weren’t watching the news. 

Over in the parking lot, the rental car; a scratched, year 2499 Honda Civic with cracked interior trim and a cheap pine tree air freshener swinging from the mirror.

“Good enough.”

---

The highway out of Calgary ran long and flat, cutting through yellowed prairie and distant foothills like a blade. The sky overhead was wide, too wide, smeared with thin clouds that looked like fingerprints on a windshield.

The Chuckwagon Café was about an hour south, out near Diamond Valley, a place he’d never even heard of until a dream told him it mattered.

### I. The Arrival at the Chuckwagon Café

Haoyu pulled into the gravel lot at 3:37 PM.

About half an hour early.

His tires crunched to a stop in a familiar place that ; technically ; he had never been to. The sky above was bright and windless, the kind of dry Alberta calm that made sound carry a little too far. The Chuckwagon Café stood just ahead, nestled at the edge of the prairies, looking perfectly ordinary.

Too ordinary.

He cut the engine, sat still for a moment, and just… stared.

This was the fourth time he’d seen the saloon.

But this time?

It wasn’t a dream.

He pinched the inside of his forearm ; hard.

It stung… Had to make sure it wasn’t a dream this time.

---

His mind reeled back through every appearance:

- The first time, he was sitting at the bar beside Dallas and the Oc’Xari, sharing moonshine. The boots. The line dancing. The laughter.
- The second time, in the crystallized wastelands, where he’d entered first... and Dallas vanished. The inside had twisted with alien eeriness. Wrong angles. No Dallas. Unsettling atmosphere.
- The third time, in the horrific waking vision of Nhexus, where the saloon led into a pulsing swamp of suffering; grotesque creatures shrieking from the walls, a pus pit in the center of the room, and that pig-beast in the back, staring, and the wailing howls of the mega pyramid

---

Now?

Now it was just… there.

Quiet. Plain. Wooden siding faded from sun, red-painted door, hanging “OPEN” sign gently swaying.

He sat in the car, engine off, and thought:

“Wait a second… I’ve never even BEEN here before.”

He blinked.

“I don’t know this town. I don’t know this café. I’ve never met Dallas in real life… I don’t even know if Dallas is REAL.”

He gripped the steering wheel a little tighter.

“Am I losing it? Was this all just some mass hallucination? Why am I here?”

But then; like a man finishing an argument with himself ; he let go of the questions.

There were no answers in the car.

So he stepped out, shoes meeting gravel with that satisfying crunch, and walked slowly toward the door.

---

The Chuckwagon Café stood peaceful in the late-afternoon light.

He reached for the handle

Paused, let out a sigh

Then pushed it open.

A soft jingle of the bell above the door rang out.

No shrieking beasts. No moonshine aliens. No crystalline valleys.

Just a perfectly normal, western-style café in some random small country town.

Booths in soft red leather. Worn wooden floors. Walls adorned with cowboy hats and bullhorns. A soft country song playing from unseen speakers.

And standing there by the host stand, wearing an apron and a big, warm smile, was a young woman with a notepad.

She beamed at him.

“Hey there! Welcome in! How’s your day going?”

---

Haoyu just blinked.

A beat of silence.

Then:

“...Uhh… Good.”

The young woman tilted her head, smile softening just a touch.

“That wasn’t a very reassuring ‘good.’”


“Well, I hope our food and drinks can cheer you up.”

She glanced at the tablet in her hand, then looked back up at him.

“Is the table just for you today, or...?”

Haoyu hesitated, eyes flicking toward the door.

“...I’m expecting a guest.”


“Not sure if he’ll show up, but... he’s supposed to arrive at four.”

She nodded with gentle professionalism.

“No worries at all. I’ll seat you right by the window so you can see the parking lot and folks coming in.”


“Take your time with the order. I can bring you a coffee while you wait.”

“Sure,” Haoyu said, with a small grateful nod. “Black, please.”

---

She led him to a booth nestled by the front window. The sun filtered through the dusty glass, casting lazy shadows over the tabletop ; real, solid, warm.

Haoyu slid into the booth slowly.

Sat back.

Exhaled.

He looked out the window at the gravel lot where his car was still parked. A pickup truck pulled in, someone with a cowboy hat got out… not Dallas, and walked inside without a glance.

Haoyu looked down at the smooth menu.

The napkin dispenser.

The sugar packets in their little holder.

The warmth of the ceramic mug when the server brought his coffee.

All of it grounded.

All of it real.

He finally collected himself.

And with a slow breath, he thought:

“This isn’t a dream.”


*“This is actually happening.”*

*“I’m in a café in a town I never knew existed… waiting for a man I’ve only ever met in dreams.”*

He picked up the coffee.

Took a sip.

Looked at the door.

And waited.

It was 4:25.

Haoyu’s eyes flicked down to his watch again, then to the clock on the wall, then back to his phone screen.

Still the same numbers.

He exhaled through his nose ; barely audible, but tight.

The coffee was long gone.

Two glasses of water, drained.

He’d adjusted the sugar packets into a perfect row and then ruined the arrangement just to do something with his hands.

The waitress had checked on him twice ; once at 4:05, again at 4:18. The second time, she gave a sympathetic smile and asked if he was sure his guest was still coming.

He had nodded politely.

Now his knee bounced beneath the table.

His eyes darted to the door as it opened…

Not Dallas… Just some other random cowboy.

A man in overalls had walked in earlier. A group of teens had shuffled past, laughing over milkshakes. But no Dallas.

“How long should I wait?”


*“Where is he?”*

*“Was he real?”*

*“Was any of this real?”*

He rubbed his temples, elbows on the table, trying to steady his breathing.

“Jesus Christ…”


*“How did I just… get up and go to fucking Alberta in the middle of my court trial dates…”*

*“And just expect to find a cowboy from a dream?”*

His reflection in the window caught him off guard. He looked tired. Out of place. Almost foolish.

“What the hell am I doing here?”

His phone buzzed once.

It wasn’t a message.

Just the weather update.

Cloudy skies, mild winds, 16°C.

No signs. No omens.

Just the weight of waiting.

And doubt.

4:41 PM.

Haoyu glanced at his watch one last time, let out a quiet sigh through his nose, and slowly stood up.

He went to use the restroom after drinking all that water and coffee.

As he finished up, he came back out, and the waitress smiled with excitement and exclaimed “your friend arrived!” 

Haoyu almost in shock, had to rub his eyes, glanced at the table he was just sitting at… and low and behold… There sat an old grizzled cowboy. It was Dallas.

There wasn’t no alien, there wasn’t any moonshine - hell, this place wasn’t even a bar… it was just a cafe, that sold coffee, burgers and pies… it was a lot different than all the crazy dreams.

---

### II. The First Real Conversation

Haoyu approached the table slowly. His boots felt heavier than before. His pulse ; somehow calm and racing at once.

Dallas looked up from the laminated menu with a wry grin, cowboy hat tilted back just enough to show the lines carved deep into his sun-worn face.

“Well I’ll be damned,” Dallas said, his voice low and dusted with that familiar prairie drawl.


“It *is* you.”

Haoyu stopped beside the booth. Still standing.

His eyes narrowed slightly.

“You know me?”

Dallas chuckled ; just once ; and set the menu down.

“Whole damn world knows you, Commander Zhang.”


“You’re all over the feeds. Courtroom footage. Leaked recordings. Alien rover broadcasts.”

“Hell, I saw your face on the *Weather Channel* last week.”

He motioned to the seat across from him.

“Sit. Coffee’s hotter than a tractor hood in July.”

Haoyu didn’t sit. Not yet.

“You’re Dallas.”

“Yup.”

“How are you real?”

Dallas didn’t answer right away. He scratched his jaw, then took a slow sip of his own coffee ; black, just like Haoyu’s.

“That’s a hell of a question.”


“I got an even crazier question for you; How many times have you been at this Cafe now?

Haoyu blinked.

“...Yeah. Four times now. The first was fun. The second got weird. The third was straight-up terrifying, and the fourth time… is right now.”

“Right? That second one,” Dallas nodded, “I walked in... and you were gone.”

Haoyu turned to him sharply.

“Exactly. I was alone. My court trial was playing on the TV and the aliens were watching.”

Dallas looked over, raising an eyebrow.

“That’s so weird, ‘cause in my dream, it was the same thing, except you were the one who vanished. I remember walkin’ through that crystal valley and opening the door to the saloon. And you never came inside, I looked out the window to check for you, but you were gone. I was there alone with a dozen Watchers watchin’ footage of your trial.”

They both sat with that - goosebumps rose on both their arms.

Two dreams. Opposite ends of the same memory.

“I can’t believe we are both here, talking about this” Haoyu said softly

“Yeah, I wasn’t totally sure you’d even be here.” Dallas replied. “Ain’t that a head-kicker.”

Haoyu hesitated for a second, then said quietly:

“Did you ever see... a pig-like thing? In one of the dreams? Inside the saloon, when it turned into; Nhexus?”

Dallas’s jaw tensed. His hands tightened slightly on the wheel.

“Yeah,” he said. “I saw it. Big bastard. Didn’t move much, but... it was wrong. Just sittin’ there... staring into my soul, like it knew somethin’.”

Haoyu nodded slowly, his face pale.

“It glared at me. Like it was angry we were there. Like we weren’t supposed to see it.”

Dallas muttered, eyes on the road.

“I don’t get spooked easy. But that thing... it wasn’t just ugly. It was evil. That’s the word. Don’t like us pokin’ around that part of the story.”

They were both quiet for a long moment.

Then, as if by mutual unspoken agreement, they steered the conversation elsewhere.

Haoyu leaned forward.

“So, we’ve never met each other, and I’ve never even been to Canada, why are we here?”


“Why Alberta? Why this café? Why did we dream of this place?”

Dallas lowered his gaze for a moment, rubbing his knuckles along the table’s edge.

“That part’s been botherin’ me too, I never even knew about this town, let alone the cafe.”


“But I’ll tell you this much ; the Oc’Xari are watching our every move, and listening to every word we say. When they were in the Saloon watching you on TV, it became clear to me that for some reason you and me are the center of the stage for their entire planet..”

Dallas glanced around the Chuckwagon Café, eyes scanning the quaint wooden decor, the soft country music, the dessert board scrawled with chalk.

He leaned back a little and muttered:

“Y’know... kinda funny thing.”


“There ain’t even a bar in this place.”

Haoyu was thinking of that earlier as well

“Yeah,” he said slowly. “I noticed that too.”


“No booze, no stools, no shelves with weird whiskey labels. Just... tables. Pie. All day breakfast. Cafe Style Sandwiches. And decaf.”

He looked toward the back of the café, where a humble soda fountain stood next to a glass case of lemon meringue slices.

“This place closes at five,” Haoyu added - as he looks at the time again reading at 4:57pm


“The sign on the door says ‘Closed Sundays. No Loitering.’ I asked the waitress earlier ; they don’t even do evening service.”

“They *definitely* don’t host cowboy dance parties with aliens.”

Dallas gave a dry chuckle and shook his head.

“Then where the hell did all that happen?”


“The boots. The guitar. That Oc’Xari fella singin’ that damned song...”

Haoyu said nothing.

He was staring out the window again, watching the slow drift of a pickup truck down the gravel road, stirring up dust that never quite settled.

“We saw the same place,” he said finally.


“But it wasn’t *this* place. It was *wearing* this place. Same shell. Different rules.”

“Like the Oc’Xari were trying to get us comfortable. Give us something familiar... before peeling it apart.”

Dallas nodded slowly.

“You ever been to one of those cowboy reenactment towns, what is it… a Potemkin village?”


“Everything looks real from the outside. But behind the saloon doors it’s just plywood and rope lights.”

He took another sip of coffee.

“What if we’re sittin’ in the plywood version now?”

Haoyu turned toward him.

“So then what ; you think we came here because they wanted us to?”


“Because they left us a trail? A place to reconnect the dots?”

Dallas set his mug down, eyes steady.

“No.”


“I think they wanted us to meet. And this was the only place on Earth where the dream and the waking world were close enough to *touch.*”

Haoyu frowned, mind racing.

“So... we’re like two tuning forks. Same note. Resonating from different ends of the galaxy.”


“And this café is like a weird gateway, or has some kind of special energy for them, the one place where the sound doesn’t cancel out.”

Dallas nodded slowly.

“That’s poetically put, Commander.”


“But yeah. Somethin’ like that.”

They both sat in silence again, each sipping their now lukewarm coffees, staring not at each other ; but at the strange, ordinary reality surrounding them. 

---

### III. The Ol’ Brand New Truck

A small chime echoed from the kitchen.

The waitress appeared, now without the earlier sparkle of greeting ; her apron slightly rumpled, tablet tucked under one arm, tired smile on her lips.

“Just a heads up, fellas. We close in about a minute, but no rush ; take your time wrapping up.”

Dallas nodded, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a worn leather wallet. Haoyu instinctively did the same. A quiet shuffle of bills. Dallas tucked a modest tip under the edge of the empty pie plate and scribbled something on the receipt that might have been a thank-you or a doodle of a steer.

They stepped outside into the early sunset of prairie dusk.

The door swung shut behind them with a soft clunk. The gravel lot stretched quiet and empty, save for two parked vehicles ; Haoyu’s nondescript rental... and the other.

Haoyu froze mid-step.

The sky had dimmed just enough that the chrome trim gleamed faintly in the fading light. Red paint. Cream trim. Gleaming lines. Rounded fenders like shoulders hunched in thought.

A 1950 Ford F1 pickup.

Perfect condition.

Haoyu squinted, brow furrowing.

“I feel like I’ve seen this truck before.”

Dallas tilted his hat back and smirked.

“Yeah. Remember? You helped me pump gas into it.”

Haoyu blinked hard, eyes darting between the truck and Dallas.

“We’ve never met before...”

Dallas just smiled and started toward the truck.

“Yeah we have… You were standin’ next to me at that gas station just outside some crystallized alien planet version of Pincher Creek, pumping premium grade like you’ve done it a hundred times.”

Haoyu staggered for a half-step, mind reeling like static in a storm.

“I… no, that’s... that wasn’t real. That wasn’t... how could we both remember the same dream?”

Dallas chuckled, unlatching the tailgate to toss in his jacket.

“Welcome to the show, Commander.”

Haoyu stared at the truck, then back at Dallas.

“Alright. Seriously though... where did you get this thing? It’s over five hundred years old now. It looks brand new.”

Dallas shut the tailgate with a soft *clack*.

“That’s the weird part,” he said calmly. “It just showed up one morning. End of spring. I thought maybe some old rancher dumped it on my land. But when I checked the papers inside; insurance, registration, VIN plate and all; it’s registered to some guy named James Bethoz.”

Haoyu’s face went pale.

“James... Bethoz?”

Dallas nodded.

“Yup. Ring a bell?”

Haoyu rubbed his temples.

“He owns, like... half the tech industry in the United States. He’s ex-CEO of LunarNet, part owner of Equinox Drive, and last I heard, he’s trying to buy real estate on Titan.”

He looked back at the truck, alarm rising in his voice.

“Dallas… if that’s his truck... and it just appeared after an alien gave you some guitar artifact...”

He stepped back, staring at it now like it might explode.

“He’s definitely looking for it. Hell, the CIA might be looking for it. This whole parking lot could be under surveillance right now!”

Dallas chuckled again, slowly and dryly this time.

“I mean, could be. Or maybe... this truck didn’t just show up for no reason. Maybe it was meant to show up. Just like you were.”

He patted the hood once, like greeting an old friend.

“Come on. I’ll drive.”

Haoyu looked at the truck, then at Dallas.

Then he exhaled.

And got in.

As Haoyu settled into the worn passenger seat, the upholstered, quality leather cushioned softly beneath him. Dallas slid the key into the ignition, gave it a confident twist

WHUUMMP-k-k-k-KRRAAHHHT-WHAAAHM.

The Ford F1 roared awake, coughing and snarling like an old dragon pulling itself from a long slumber. The dashboard rattled faintly. The mirrors vibrated. The smell of faint oil and something *mechanical* filled the cab.

Haoyu instinctively flinched, gripping the handle on the door… in the 26th century, cars don’t make noises like that anymore, so it caught Haoyu off guard.

“What the hell was that?”

Dallas laughed, low and content.

“That, partner, is the sound of the 20th century.”

They pulled away from the gravel lot, the truck rumbling deep beneath them ; not the smooth electric whir Haoyu was used to, not the hum of grav-drive or mag-suspension. This was grit and fire, pistons and combustion, the ghost of an era long gone.

But even still…

Haoyu felt it.

The ride was smooth. Surreal, even.

The suspension was soft, steady. The seat molded around him like a memory. Everything *should* have clunked and rattled; but it didn’t. The truck moved like it remembered a time when the world was slower, and more certain.

They looped around the block once, tires whispering over old prairie asphalt, past quiet homes and yellowing grass fields. Then circled back into the café lot, pulling up beside Haoyu’s bland rental.

The engine idled like a distant drum.

Haoyu turned, still absorbing the strange comfort of the ride.

“So…” he said, finally, “you mentioned the guitar. With the map on it?”

He glanced at Dallas.

“Can I see it?”

Dallas shifted in his seat, leaning back and reaching for the door handle.

“C’mon. It’s in the back.”

They stepped out into the cooling prairie air. The truck’s engine ticked quietly as it settled from the short drive. Dallas walked to the back and untied the rope that fastened a lumpy tarp over the truck bed. With a practiced flick, he pulled it aside to reveal an old, beaten-down guitar case ; the kind that looked like it had been on a thousand barroom stages.

He popped the latches.

Inside, nestled in worn velvet, was the guitar.

It shimmered faintly.

Not with paint or polish ; but with something *beneath* the surface. Its dark wood held faint starlight patterns, glowing just enough to be seen, as if the constellations themselves were embedded inside the grain. Strings of unfamiliar alloy. The pickguard etched in geometric spirals.

Haoyu leaned in slowly.

Brows furrowed.

“This… this is beautiful, but I have no idea what I’m looking at.”

He ran a hand just above the surface ; not touching it ; the way one might regard a dangerous relic.

“It’s like a map… but the coordinates don’t align with anything I know. Too many dimensions. Too many intersections.”

Dallas scratched the back of his head.

“I figured it was some kind of starmap. I tried lining it up with the Big Dipper and Orion and all that but… nothin’ makes sense.”

Haoyu exhaled.

“Yeah. It’s… beyond me.”

He stared a moment longer, then stepped back, his mind already racing.

“But it wouldn’t be beyond my team.”

Dallas raised a brow.

“Your what-now?”

Haoyu turned, speaking quickly now.

“My team. From Echofall. We had a crew of twenty-two ; astrophysicists, biologists, systems engineers, planetary geologists, linguistic AI analysts, the works. We built the interstellar telemetry for the Nhexus probe and drove it around the surface of the planet before it all got shut down. Most of them are unemployed now. Blacklisted or burned out.”

Dallas watched him closely.

“You want to bring them here?”

“Yes. I can call all 22 of them and see who has the time, money and effort to come out.”

He hesitated, then added, a little sheepishly:

“We’d need a place to work. I know it’s a lot to ask on our first date, but… think we could hole up in your barn for a while?”

Dallas raised an amused brow at that.

Haoyu pressed on.

“I mean it. This guitar could hold answers to the biggest question humanity’s ever asked. I spent twenty years on the Echofall project, and when the panic started, they buried us. The whole damn thing. But now…”

He gestured to the guitar, voice quieter.

“Now the aliens gave us something. A message. Maybe a map. And I’ll be honest… I’m supposed to be back in court in two days. I’m probably going to prison for at least a decade. But it almost seems like the aliens chose us to figure out this map, that’s never happened before in human history…”

A silence settled between them.

Dallas looked down at the guitar.

Then nodded.

“Alright. We’ll set up shop in the barn. Plenty of space. Power too. Might need to chase the raccoons out first, but you’ll manage.”

“And the crew?”

“Yeah. Call your crew, hell… call your wife and kids too, bring them all. I’ll head into Calgary with you, we’ll drop off your rental, grab a hotel downtown, and I’ll stash the truck in the underground garage. You can meet your folks there. We’ll head back down to the ranch in the morning.”

Haoyu exhaled, the weight of months lifting from his shoulders.

“Thank you. Seriously.”

Dallas shrugged.

“Don’t thank me yet. Just don’t let your alien map blow a hole through my barn.”

---

By 6:05 PM, they had made it to Calgary. Haoyu and Dallas pulled their vehicles into the underground garage of a modest hotel near the river. Haoyu was on his phone calling all 22 members of his crew, including his wife on the road to Calgary. Out of the 22 crew, only the four crew members responded as available; Dr. Pragnya Reddy (bio-interface signal analysis), Yuyan Chan (planetary geologist and astrophysicist),  Steven Young (Cloud Infrastructure and Telecommunications Engineer), and fourth, Dmitry Alexeyev, (the Lead Systems Engineer from Echofall), along with Haoyu’s wife and kids would land early the next morning..

Tomorrow, the real work would begin.
Dallas and Haoyu went to sleep without much conversation, and thankfully- no dreams that night.

# Chapter 21 - Calgary

### I. The Calgary Airport

**7:42 AM** - Calgary International Airport

![iceart._Arrival_hall_of_Russian_airport._People_stand_and_greet_5b464e3a-f4cc-4b84-a4fa-4c9ebfa1c352.png](Chapter%2021%20-%20Calgary/iceart._Arrival_hall_of_Russian_airport._People_stand_and_greet_5b464e3a-f4cc-4b84-a4fa-4c9ebfa1c352.png)

The arrivals gate was a chaotic mess of movement and noise ; suitcases slamming, babies crying, wheels squeaking, impatient folks rushing around.

But then the crowd parted just enough.

And there they were.

Haoyu’s kids saw him first.

Haoyu’s son clutched a stuffed dinosaur like a talisman of safety. His daughter yawned wide enough to pop her jaw. Haoyu’s wife looked somewhere between relieved and *pissed*.

“Baba!” she cried, leaping straight into his chest.

Haoyu dropped to one knee, arms wide, and caught them both as they collided into him like a tidal wave of small limbs and sobs and overdue affection. His son didn’t say anything ; he just squeezed tighter, dinosaur pressed between them like an old friend reunited too.

“We missed you so much,” his daughter mumbled into his shoulder.

“I missed you too,” Haoyu whispered, pressing his face into their hair, eyes stinging.

Then came his wife.

She didn’t say anything at first either.

Just walked toward him slowly with a look that blended **relief**, **exhaustion**, and **repressed fury**. But when she reached him, she pulled him into a long, **tight hug** ; one hand gripping the back of his neck, the other resting gently over his heart.

“I should slap you,” she muttered in Mandarin.

“I’d probably deserve it,” he replied.

But her hand didn’t move. She just held him a second longer.

Dallas leaned against a post near the terminal doors, sipping expensive terrible airport coffee like it was cheap whiskey. He watched the ragtag team emerge behind Haoyu’s family: Dmitry Alexeyev, bleary-eyed and already swearing at his tablet in Russian, offered a curt nod and a handshake that turned into a shoulder-grab, a relic of an old-world comrade’s greeting. He’d worked two decades on the Echofall project, spending winters in Chicago, Huntsville, D.C., and even Montana.

**Yuyan Chan** stepped forward next, all calm smiles and tidy mannerisms ; sleeves neatly rolled, hair combed even after the flight.

Haoyu turned to face him.

They clasped hands and gave each other the **double-nod of respect** ; the traditional greeting from **Mainland China**, practiced even after years abroad.

“Laoshi,” Jonny said softly, referring to Haoyu as “teacher” ; a term of endearment and esteem from their university days.

“Xiansheng,” Haoyu replied, nodding once more. “It’s good to see you again.”

And then came Steven Young, loping up with his signature lopsided grin.

Steven was a big man, great beard, wore a cowboy hat far too pristine for someone who claimed it wasn’t his first rodeo, a jean jacket over a NASA tank top, cargo shorts, and flip-flops. Slung over his shoulder was a custom bio-spectrum scanner that looked like it’d been duct-taped together during a hurricane.

He gave Dallas a nod.

“Nice to finally meet you, Mr. Red Ranch. I’m Steven. From Florida born and bred.”


“Soon as we crack that alien guitar, I’m takin’ you swamp chicken huntin’ down in the Everglades.”

Dallas blinked.

“Swamp... chicken?”

“Oh yeah,” Steven said with a grin, pushing his cowboy hat back. “That what we call them gators, taste just like a giant chicken from a swamp.”

Dallas raised a skeptical brow, looking at his shorts and flip flops.

“You know it ain’t Florida weather up here, right?”

Steven squinted out the glass of the airport windows seeing glimpses of the low, grey prairie sky.

“How bad can it be? Never been to Canada, let alone the prairies, but it’s just flatlands like Texas, right?”

Dallas muttered something under his breath about frostbite and hubris…

After a few more exchanges the final crew member arrived;

Dr. Pragnya Reddy came striding through the gate like she was late for a launch sequence, hair tied in a messy bun, half-buttoned lab coat thrown over travel sweats, and a duffel bag that looked like it had been repurposed from an old satellite payload.

She didn’t bother with small talk ; just clapped Haoyu on the shoulder and muttered:

“I’ve never seen an alien map before… so I can’t promise to be useful, but, I’ll do my best”

---

They began shuffling towards the parking garage, wheeling bags and slinging backpacks like a ragtag expedition team trying to catch a train to another planet.

Dallas glanced over at Yuyan Chan, who was eyeing the F1 truck with a mix of curiosity and alarm.

“I can tell by the way you’re dressed,” Dallas said, tipping his hat, “you ain’t never sat in a 500-year-old pickup before.”


“So congratulations ; you’re ridin’ shotgun with me.”

Yuyan blinked behind his glasses, cracked a small grin, and shrugged.

“Guess I’m overdue for some culture shock.”

Dallas smirked and clapped him on the back before heading for the truck.

---

Meanwhile, at the rental car, the trunk packed to the brim with luggage - probably broke a couple things trying to force the lid shut. Haoyu's wife and kids settled into the backseat first. His daughter curled up with her stuffed toy in her lap, sitting on the wifes left knee. His son mashed buttons on a dead tablet, already bored, sitting uncomfortably and finicking on the wifes right knee. His wife sighed, gave Haoyu one last *"you better know what you're doing"* look, then in climbed Dmitry and Dr. Pragnya Reddy - all stuffed into the backseat uncomfortably like tight packed sardines in a can

Dmitry muttered something about elbow room and began scanning for satellite interference with a repurposed comms sniffer. Pragnya was already halfway into her laptop, mumbling about thermal degradation patterns in alien alloys.

The last to climb in was **Steven Young**, who ; as the **largest of the bunch** ; was assigned the **passenger seat**, otherwise there’s no way everyone would’ve fit in the back.

As soon as the door shut and Haoyu turned the ignition, Steven was already talking.

“Man, I flew in from Florida this morning, and lemme tell you ; I’ve been in swamps, hurricanes, and once inside a hollowed-out gator with three busted ribs. But this Canadian cold?”


He pulled his jean jacket tighter over his chest and gestured vaguely out the windshield.

“This *ain’t right*. My puppies (toes) are mad at me.”

Haoyu snorted softly.

“Should’ve worn boots.”

“I got flip-flops with good grip,” Steven shot back proudly. “Hell, I’ll take you out with real swamp cowboys to wrangle some boar sometime, Commander. Teach ya how to tickle a catfish in a sinkhole with one hand and make moonshine with the other.”

“Sounds a lot better than spending the remainder of my days in prison.” replied Haoyu

The car rolled forward, pulling out of the garage behind the Ford.

Haoyu glanced in the mirror ; at his wife and kids, his friends, and the stacks of old gear beside them. Then he looked over at Steven, who was now adjusting the heat vents with a suspicious look.

“Alright,” Haoyu said, tightening his grip on the wheel.


“Let’s talk next steps. We’ve got a starmap no one understands. We’ve got four brilliant minds, a barn full of power tools… we can buy whatever lab equipment we need, a guitar etched with a map of the galaxy, and a five-century-old truck that an alien stole from a billionaire.”

He looked ahead as the highway opened up.

“Let’s figure out what the hell the universe is trying to tell us.”

---

### II. The Road to Saskatchewan

The drive from **Calgary to Swift Current** was a full **five hours** ; and for the crew **crammed into Haoyu’s rental**, it felt more like *fifteen*.

Legs tangled. Elbows jousted. One of the kids dropped a juice box somewhere under the seat, and no one could reach it. Dmitry and Pragnya tried to coordinate logistics on their laptops, typing sideways with one hand while shielding screens from glare. Haoyu’s wife shifted constantly in the middle row, and the youngest burst into tears twice before falling asleep in a lopsided sprawl.

“Next time,” Steven muttered, pulling his jean jacket up over his face, “I’m renting a damn bus.”

Haoyu gripped the steering wheel like it was the only thing anchoring him to sanity, eyes fixed on the endless stretch of two-lane highway.

---

Meanwhile, in the Ford F1, it was paradise.

The sun cut wide golden beams across the horizon, the engine rumbled low like a sleeping dragon, and the prairie rolled out in all directions like a breathing canvas. Dallas’ ragged cowboy boots down to the floor of the gas pedal. Yuyan Chan had his feet in dressy loafers on the dash, aviators reflecting the grainfields, and a giddy grin that refused to fade.

“I get it now,” Yuyan said, wind teasing at his hair through the cracked window. “I get the cowboy thing.”

Dallas just chuckled.

“Told ya. Ain’t nothin’ between here and the stars but air and story.”


He tapped the dash lovingly.

“She’s been waitin’ five hundred years to do this drive.”

They didn’t talk much after that.

Didn’t need to.

The road sang beneath the tires, the sky stayed wide and wordless, and the old truck just kept on going ; like it knew the way.

The long prairie road narrowed into a dirt drive, flanked on either side by whispering grasslands and broken fence lines. As they crested the last rise, the house and barn came into view ; and Haoyu instinctively hit the brakes for just a second, letting the moment settle over them all.

The ranch house stood proud and tall against the pale blue sky, wrapped in classic cedar plank siding. But where age should have left cracks and faded corners, there was none of it. Instead, the entire home looked… *preserved.* No, restored ; but *better*. The wood retained its earthy, time-worn charm, but gleamed as if freshly sanded and sealed every morning by invisible hands. The white-trimmed windows glinted in the sunlight. Brass door handles bore alien-clean precision, engraved in subtle motifs that seemed to shimmer only when you weren't looking directly at them.

It felt like a century-old prairie home, but... upgraded by someone who respected the past.

“Holy hell,” Pragnya muttered in the back seat. “Did you say he lived alone? In this?”

“This place looks like if a luxury resort designer and a blacksmith got drunk together in the woods,” Steven added, genuinely impressed.

The barn across the yard was a similar paradox. Still clad in old red paneling, but reinforced with shimmering metallic ribbing along the beams, and decorative hinges of gold, silver, and bronze. The roof held a solar array so discreet it looked like frost from afar.

As the caravan parked, car doors popped open in rapid succession. Stretching, groaning, gear clanking. The rental car had transformed into a pressurized can of humans and computing equipment over the five-hour trip ; an olfactory mix of coffee, takeout wrappers, and kid snacks. As Haoyu opened the trunk, a backpack fell out on his foot. He didn’t even flinch.

But all discomfort disappeared when his kids jumped out and ran straight into him.

“DADDY!!”

His daughter practically climbed him like a tree, her small arms locking around his neck, while his son gripped his leg with fierce, wordless joy ; still clutching his stuffed dinosaur like it might vanish if he let go.

Haoyu dropped to one knee, arms wrapping around them both.

“I’m here. I’m okay. I’m right here.”

His voice caught ; cracking with all the pressure he hadn’t let out in months. The weight of failed missions, media trials, planetary silence... all gone, crushed beneath two pairs of tiny arms.

His wife stepped forward, crossing her arms ; but not in anger. Her face was taut, exhausted, but she couldn’t hide the wet shimmer in her eyes.

“I thought you’d lost your mind.”

“I wasn’t sure I hadn’t, and now you can understand - this place is off the map, the government and law enforcement will never find us here! We’re safe.” Haoyu replied confidently, standing up slowly. “But remember when I told you about that first dream? The one with all the aliens dancing out in the field here? Cowboy boots and hats, line dancing under the stars?”

She blinked. Slowly.

Her gaze swept over the house. The porch. The field.

Then back to the barn.

Then to Dallas ; who nodded politely, cowboy hat tipped, clearly real.

“Holy shit,” she whispered. “You weren’t crazy…”

“No,” Haoyu said quietly. “Or if I was ; at least now we’re all crazy together.”

She leaned in and kissed his cheek. No theatrics. Just *real*.

Inside the house, it was clear: they had *more than enough space*.

the house was warm and alive. The wooden floors didn’t creak. The scent of cedar and iron mingled faintly in the air. Copper light fixtures glowed gently with no visible wires. Every door fit perfectly in its frame.

Haoyu’s wife and kids claimed the spacious living room ; their makeshift beds laid out around the central hearth. Pillows became forts. The kids' laughter echoed off the high beams as they found old board games in a carved drawer beneath the TV.

For once, Haoyu wasn’t checking the news. Or his court alerts. Or the trajectory data from the long-dead Nhexus feed.

He was just... *home*. If only for a moment.

“Still pissed at you,” his wife said softly, laying a blanket on the floor.


“I know.” said Haoyu

“But... you’re here. We’re here… and the kids are so happy.”

“Yeah. They’ve been playing and laughing like they’ve never had before.” responded Haoyu

“And it’s nice, that you aren’t working… I know it’s not ideal, but I think this will be the most we will see each other in a very long time.” Said the wife in a loving manner, cuddling up closer to Haoyu, exhilarating loving smiles on both of their faces

Let’s give them some privacy; in the meantime;

Pragnya claimed the room upstairs across from Dallas’. She opened her portable console like it was a suitcase of sacred relics and began configuring diagnostics against the freshly lacquered windowsill.

“Not bad for a haunted house,” she muttered, adjusting her lenses.

Yuyan Chan and Dmitry quietly set up two bedrolls in the next room over ; Yuyan’s projection star-map blinking lazily on the ceiling as Dmitry removed a weatherproof antenna core and placed it in the window frame.

“Room’s got strange harmonics,” Yuyan noted. “Good for telemetry.”

“Good for silence,” Dmitry replied, already halfway into a nap.

---

And then ; the barn.

Steven Young had already claimed it like a wild raccoon finding a dumpster behind a fine dining restaurant.

He stood in the threshold, cowboy hat in hand, eyes glimmering like a child seeing a spaceship for the first time.

“Now this... this is a damn holy temple of backcountry quantum science.”

He stomped across the reinforced floor panels, echoing dramatically.

“We’re settin’ up the lab here, command station there, and my bedroom? Right up in that hayloft. Give me a power strip, hot dog and a beer ; I’m golden.”

Dallas appeared in the doorway, flicking a dishrag over his shoulder.

“Just don’t rewire the place till we get the cattle fed.”

“Cattle?” Steven blinked. “Wait, are there actual cows here?”

“Two. They’re real judgy. Don’t take it personal.” Dallas remarked, walking away… then stopped before leaving the bar “Oh, and don’t mind the six legged donkey”
Steven stood in his boots like a deer in headlights, scratching his head, whispering to himself “a six legged… Huh?!”

---

By late afternoon, Dallas had food sizzling on the stovetop ; sourdough on the griddle, bacon crisping beside it, and a chili stew simmering with vegetables he picked from the root cellar earlier that week.

The house buzzed with quiet science activity ; data being unpacked, spectrum readers warming up, and the guitar ; in its case, wrapped in tarp in the barn ; waiting.

Waiting to be understood.

And under the vast prairie sky, the *team was finally together*.

Ready.

The last orange threads of dusk had long vanished when the ranch finally stilled.

The barn, once creaking with life and voices, had fallen into a hushed electronic hum ; portable stations blinking soft red and green in the dark like eyes waiting to wake. Upstairs in the house, the warmth of life had settled thickly into its old-but-reborn walls, courtesy of alien renovations that preserved every creak and groove while somehow making it... pristine.

Out there, just past the barn doors, Steven Young had fallen asleep on a haybale like it was a 5-star mattress, hat over his eyes, flip-flops kicked off, and a half-empty mason jar barely hanging in the grasp of his loosely relaxed hand

He snored like a mountain lion with allergies.

Pragnya had laid claim to the room nearest Dallas’, and the woman wasted no time ; bags dumped, laptop charging, and boots off in record speed. She said she needed quiet to “align the neural overlays” from her latest string-mapped system threads. Dallas didn’t ask.

Across the hall, Dmitry and Yuyan unrolled their bedrolls like old comrades on a campaign. Yuyan, cheerful and wiry, was already debating atmospheric conversion theory through a mouthful of granola. Dmitry, quiet, focused, affixed a small dish-like sensor to the outer window, a tuned telemetry snare, designed to pick up spectral anomalies, geopathic EM variance, and most importantly... Oc’Xari interference.

Downstairs, the kids were already zonked ; curled on blankets like kittens beside a low-burning pellet stove. One clutched a dinosaur, the other still had socks on backward. Haoyu’s wife, after a long shower and a longer sigh, finally laid beside Haoyu on the twin mattresses pushed together.

Together. Finally.

She traced the edge of his face with her fingertips ; not needing to say a word at first.

Haoyu exhaled, eyes soft.

“You remember when I told you about that first dream? The one with the Oc’Xari dancing in cowboy hats? You and me and the kids out in the field with ‘em?”

She gave a little scoff, smirking through disbelief.

“Yeah. I figured you were either hallucinating or finally having a full-blown nervous breakdown.”

He laughed lightly.

“I thought so too. God, I almost hoped I was.”

She pulled closer, resting her forehead against his.

“But you weren’t.”

A breath passed between them.

“You really weren’t.”

They kissed ; gently, lovingly.

Then silence.

“You know,” Haoyu whispered, “I think this was the best mistake I’ve ever made. Getting fired. Running away. Skipping court…”

“Facing jail time,” she added, a little dry.

“Yeah,” he smiled. “All of it. Because now I’m finally here. With you. With them. No feeds, no meetings, no Mars briefings, no command post… Just here.”

She nodded, voice barely audible.

“We missed you, you know.”

“I missed me too.”

The house around them creaked in a warm, knowing way.

And the children, tangled in their nest of blankets, breathed deeply ; safe, warm, loved.

### III. The Watchers in the Night

At exactly 2:11 AM, Dmitry Alexeyev’s tablet pinged once ; a low, pulsing tone, like a sonar returning from too deep a depth.

His eyelids snapped open instantly.

He didn’t reach for the device like a man just waking ; he grabbed it like a trained soldier hearing the snap of enemy movement.

The pattern on-screen wasn't just familiar ; it was burned into him. He had spent decades working on Project Echofall, from the earliest concept phases of the rover’s hibernation logic to the live telemetry feeds from Nhexus. He was there during the signal breach that caused the public panic. He personally confirmed the first EM anomaly that triggered the planetary advisory. He was in the bunker when the rover sent back its final cursed image.

He knew the Oc’Xari signature by heart.

The signal pulsed again.

Localized. *Inside* the house.

Dmitry rose without a word. No shoes. Just the soft padding of a man used to moving through critical zones without alerting sensors or children.

First, Dallas’ room.

He creaked open the door ; just enough to see…

In the old farmhouse dark, it loomed. A shadow, barely distinguishable from night itself. Humanoid but wrong. Leaned over Dallas’ head like a mourner over a grave.

Its hand was inside Dallas’ skull. Not penetrating ; phasing, like a frequency breach, gently touching something beneath the conscious.

Dmitry froze - nerves shuttering through his body… but collecting himself

The entity looked up. Two faint lights where eyes should be. And then ; it raised its other hand, a finger to its lipless mouth.

Shhh.

Dmitry backed away. No argument. No protest. No scream.

Just reverence.

Another ping on his tablet ; second signal.

Downstairs.

He crept down. Past creaking floorboards, past portraits of families long gone, into the low firelight of the living room.

Another entity. Taller. More diffuse.

Standing over Haoyu and his wife, both deeply asleep ; its hand gently resting against Haoyu’s forehead like it was sifting through starlight.

Dmitry didn’t interfere. He sat across the room on a chair at the old farmhouse kitchen table ; lit only by the screen in his lap and the faintest shimmer from the being across the living room.

Dmitry and the Oc’Xari stared at each other for a long time.

No words.

# Chapter 22 - Ferron

### I. Ferron

Haoyu opened his eyes to heat.

Not stifling ; more like the inside of a smithy, rich with fire and metal and breath. The air tasted like iron and smoke.

He stood on a jagged ridge overlooking an immense city built into a slag valley, rivers of molten ore winding through obsidian rock beds. Thunder rolled in the distance ; not storm, but forge thunder ; some massive engine beating like a heart beneath the world.

He looked down.

His boots were strange ; segmented like armor. His clothes? Not his clothes. His sleeves were stitched from iron-thread fabric, glowing subtly with the same copper hue as the strings on the alien guitar.

A voice called out:

“Commander.”

Haoyu turned.

Dallas stood nearby on the ridge, similarly dressed ; but his outfit was a strange fusion of his cowboy aesthetic and something far older. He wore a long duster made of some heat-tempered cloth, a wide-brimmed metal-lined hat, and chainmail laced leather gloves.

“I guess we’re back in it,” Dallas said.

They turned together, looking out across Ferron.

Below them, figures moved ; tall, horned silhouettes ; the Rhonza. Whole processions of them, walking through the streets of the valley, hauling glowing tools, chanting in harmony. Massive towers belched smoke and light as they hammered metals into shapes.

Haoyu swallowed, his voice caught between awe and fear.

“Where the hell are we now?”

Dallas squinted out at the forge towers in the distance.

“I have no idea… is this… ancient Earth?”

<A riverside oil refinery and chemical processing center>

![28.jpg](Chapter%2022%20-%20Ferron/28.jpg)

---

Before Haoyu could respond ; before he could even wonder whether this was some ancient vision of Earth or something stranger ; a deep thudding came from behind them.

He turned fast.

From the twisted ironwood forest at their backs, five figures emerged ; Rhonza.

Each stood at least seven feet tall, walking upright on hoofed feet, their postures imposing and almost regal. Their horns curved wide like ceremonial blades, reminiscent of Texas longhorns but patterned with glowing engravings ; some chiseled, others etched like molten ink. Their skin bore faint ash-blue and brown hues, muscles coiled like they were carved from volcanic stone.

They didn’t resemble cattle; far from it.

They looked human enough to be unsettling. Their faces were long and sharp, with eyes like cooled metal. Their expressions? Stern. Exhausted. Dangerous.

Four of them carried enormous bundles of blackened, resinous logs ; tied in symmetrical stacks with bands of woven copper thread. The fifth ; clearly the leader ; walked slightly ahead with a colossal battle axe slung across his back, its haft studded with iron runes that faintly shimmered in the forge haze.

As they passed, their hooves crunched against the slag gravel.

The lead Rhonza paused beside Dallas and Haoyu, snorting through broad nostrils like he’d just caught the scent of garbage.

He looked them both up and down.

Then shouted ; voice deep and sharp ; down the valley toward the settlement below:

“Who let the rats into our logging camps again?!”

The other four barked with mocking, dismissive laughter ; and continued stomping their way down the stone path, their wood bundles balanced like toothpicks in their massive arms.

Dallas watched them go, adjusting his hat slowly.

“Well,” he muttered, “guess we’re vermin now.”

Haoyu didn’t speak. He just stared at them in awe, heart still hammering.

Down the valley, the city in view ; 

Stone homes with thatched or copper-threaded roofs dotted the hillside, but they were intersected by an impossible blend of sacred engineering ; massive bellows the size of town halls, pistons thrumming like church organs, great gears rotating skyward as if they were attempting to wind the sky itself. Pillars of black smoke drifted into the crimson clouds above.

Every building seemed to be part machine.

Some bled molten light from their seams. Others pulsed with rhythmic vibrations ; like they were alive.

Haoyu exhaled.

“This place shouldn’t exist.”

Dallas nodded, slowly.

“Feels like a factory had a kid with a cathedral and raised it in a blacksmith’s playground.”

Haoyu turned to him, voice quiet.

“They called us rats.”

Dallas shrugged.

“Better than ‘intruders.’ At least rats get left alone sometimes.”

They stood there a moment longer ; staring down at the city of flame and memory, the chanting of hammers echoing up toward them from the basin.

Then Haoyu said, more to himself than to anyone else:

“I guess… Let’s check it out.”

### II. City of Ironheart

---

They descended the ridge in silence.

The road down to the valley was steep ; carved not by intention but by years of heavy carts and iron-shod hooves wearing grooves into the earth. The deeper they walked into the basin, the louder the sound of labor became. Clanging hammers, groaning pulleys, hissing steam vents ; all chanted together in an industrial hymn that seemed older than language.

The city was alive with labour and machinery, sprawling with contradiction. The buildings were made from sticks, mud, hay, and stone, but reinforced with perfect copper latticework, gears embedded into walls like mechanical ivy. Some homes had chimneys, and others with just ceiling vents leaking blue smoke that smelled faintly like incense and battery acid.

Rhonza workers rushed past them in the narrow cobbled street, hauling massive wheelbarrows filled with glowing rods, twisted steel beams, and molten-brass cores. 

A massive horned figure bumped into Haoyu, nearly knocking him over. He caught his footing just in time, but they kept coming. Another rushed past Dallas with a hiss of steam from a shoulder-mounted pack. No apologies. No curiosity. 

Just work.

They were in the way, Dallas and Haoyu had to walk right at the side edge of the path just to barely get out of the way of all the foot traffic.

they followed the streets deeper into the city's central square, with market stalls, bustling tradesman and customers, massive crowds doing business, the noise crescendoed into a dense fog of movement and metallic breath ; and that’s when they saw it.

“Wait…” Haoyu slowed to a stop.

Dallas did too.

“Are you kidding me?”

There it was.

Right in the center of the market square, wedged between a forge-temple and a spiraled gear tower:

The Chuckwagon Café.

Same faded wooden sign.

Same red-painted doors.

Same damn hanging “OPEN” sign.

It looked absurdly normal against the alien cityscape. It didn’t belong ; and yet… it fit too well, like a glitch in the dream’s design. Exactly like it had always appeared. Dream. Memory. Real life.

Haoyu turned to Dallas.

Dallas just rubbed his chin.

“Here we go again…”

They stepped inside.

---

The interior was different this time.

Gone was the modest country charm of the real-world version. Instead ; this was a grander echo. The ceilings were twice as high, vaulted and adorned with rotating iron fans suspended on rails. The walls were built from copper-lined timber. The bar was back, stretching long across the left wall ; real mahogany-looking wood, embedded with glowing script. 

Dallas sighed in a gentle relief that the bar was back.

And behind the bar…

She stood.

Not a beast.

Not a shadow.

But a female Rhonza ; smaller than the rest they’d seen, but stunning in an uncanny way.

Her face was almost human, save for the elongated cheekbones and shimmering skin ; like brushed titanium beneath a layer of glass. Her horns stood straight up, capped in bronze rings. A chain of jewelry danced across her brow. Her tail, coiled with golden bands, swayed as she dried a glass ; but her eyes narrowed the second she saw them.

“Ugh,” she muttered.


“No rats. Get out.”

She gestured at a sign above the door, showing a rough sketch of a small, hunched rodent like critter with twitchy limbs and a giant X through it.

Dallas raised both palms, trying to calm the mood.

“Hey now, hold on. We don’t mean trouble. We just got here, and we’re trying to figure out where here is. Where are we, exactly?”

She rolled her eyes so hard it looked like they might steam.

“Ha. What a trick question, why don’t you bother someone else.”

Then she paused ; glass halfway through a polish ; squinting at them both more intently.

“Wait…”


“You’re serious.”

Haoyu and Dallas both just… nodded.

She exhaled in disbelief, then smirked ; that same sharp, cutting sarcasm as a tired city bartender who’s dealt with too many drunks.

“Well, since you two were clearly born under a rusted rock… this is Ironheart. One of the oldest, biggest cities on Ferron.”

Haoyu’s face went pale.

“Fe… Ferron?”

She tilted her head.

“Yeah, I don’t know what you rats call our world. But we ; civilized folk ; call it Ferron. Now...”

She slammed the glass down hard on the counter, loud enough to make Dallas jump.

“GET OUT.”

![u8296664269_httpss.mj.runSqs-e8iZT7Q_httpss.mj.run41vR_ds3CIA_e82b76bd-a634-45be-8c04-e70ff352e7fb_2.png](Chapter%2022%20-%20Ferron/u8296664269_httpss.mj.runSqs-e8iZT7Q_httpss.mj.run41vR_ds3CIA_e82b76bd-a634-45be-8c04-e70ff352e7fb_2.png)

<Female Rhonza bartender by the name of Jarkzi>

---

They exited quickly, backs straight, not daring to look at the patrons inside ; Rhonza merchants, traveling smiths, a few armored juggernauts drinking something thick and brown from metal mugs.

The door slammed shut behind them with a hiss of hydraulics.

They stood outside in the haze of Ironheart’s main market, the smells of steam, oil, and soot flooding their senses.

Dallas wiped his brow.

“Well,” he said. “That went better than expected.”

Haoyu just stared at the café door, still processing.

“This place isn’t just a dream anymore. It’s… a real world. A real culture. Cities. Citizens. Schedules.”

“And somehow they still hate us,” Dallas added.

“Ferron,” Haoyu repeated quietly. “It’s real.”

They both turned and looked around ; the towering smokestacks, the humming pipeline aqueducts, the forge towers in the distance.

“And we’re not just dreaming this time,” Haoyu said. “it’s like we’re being shown different parts of some grander story’.”

Dallas reached down and touched the cobblestone road beneath them. It was warm. Solid. Rough.

![u8296664269_massive_steampunk_mechanical_village_mut_huts_str_1443394a-1d19-4f54-a729-99897b8ff7d3_0(1).png](Chapter%2022%20-%20Ferron/u8296664269_massive_steampunk_mechanical_village_mut_huts_str_1443394a-1d19-4f54-a729-99897b8ff7d3_0(1).png)

<Downtown Ironheart>

### III. The Battlefield

---

Then…

The horns blared.

A deep, booming roar ; like the bellows of a molten god ; erupted from brass towers above the city. Then another. Then two more, echoing across Ironheart like a call to arms.

Chaos unfolded instantly.

Rhonza townsfolk dropped what they were doing ; wheelbarrows clattered to the side, crates of ingots spilled across the street, an anvil rolled off a cart and slammed into the gutter with a thunderous clang.

“What the hell is happening?” Dallas muttered.

Haoyu’s head whipped around, trying to parse the commotion.

From every forge-door and corner shop, Rhonza rushed into the square, donning leather aprons, iron-studded chainmail, hastily fastening armor pieces and pulling weapons from racks: forge-hammers, blade-hooks, molten-blades still steaming from their scabbards.

Then like an invisible force parting water ; the crowd split down the middle.

A battalion marched through.

A hundred Rhonza ; uniformed, elite, brutal. Their plated armor painted ceremonial-red, adorned in gleaming filigree and steam-vented exhaust ports, helm-crests of razor-sharp spikes glowing in rhythmic pulses of orange light.

“Sweet mother of steam…” Dallas whispered.

Each soldier carried a warhammer, battle axe or claymore the size of a man. Some bore cannon-like rifles on their backs, others lugged shoulder-slung bows and seismic polearms that rippled with kinetic glyphs.

The entire square thundered under their synchronized march, boots pounding iron against stone.

Behind them, townsfolk ; no longer merchants and smiths but militia ; scrambled to follow. With only leather jerkin, scorched mail, and tools-turned-weapons, they yelled and shoved their way toward the front gates, where the horns had signaled an incoming assault.

“We need to move ” Haoyu began, but it was already too late.

They were caught in the stampede.

Dozens of Rhonza pushed past, grunting orders, barking in their clanging, steam-infused tongue. Haoyu and Dallas were nearly flattened by a passing trebuchet being rolled through the market like a toy car.

“To the wall! TO THE WALL!” a horned woman screamed, holding a steel-spear with a sack of throwing shrapnel slung over her back.

“Shit this way!” Dallas yanked Haoyu by the arm, the two of them forced to huddle in the corner between two brass columns framing an arched stonework.

They pressed back against a copper drainpipe and watched the endless stream of war-bound bodies thunder past.

Then… silence.

Within minutes, the square was empty.

Scattered metal still clattered against the stone as wind pushed over abandoned carts. A tool rack fell over in the distance. Smoke from a toppled incense kiln curled lazily in the air.

Only the echo of distant shouting remained ; and the growing drumbeats of war from outside the city walls.

Haoyu caught his breath, blinking in the sudden stillness.

“We need to decide,” he said. “Do we follow them? See what they’re facing?”

Dallas still watched the direction the soldiers had marched off in.

“Could be nothin’. Could be… a dream-version of some tribal skirmish. But…” he squinted toward the gates.


“I got a bad feelin’. This ain’t just some fantasy war.”

Haoyu looked back toward the Chuckwagon Café ; still just sitting there in the square, like some glitch in the world’s logic.

“I think we were shown this for a reason,” he said. “And whatever they’re about to fight… maybe it’s what we’re here to see.”

Dallas nodded.

“Let’s find out what’s knockin’ on Ferron’s front door.”

And with that, they stepped out of the alley ; into the emptied square ; and followed the path toward the frontlines.

![480890966_122228794256031351_4867928752944371320_n.jpg](Chapter%2022%20-%20Ferron/480890966_122228794256031351_4867928752944371320_n.jpg)

<Battalions lining up in formation>

---

They scrambled through the abandoned square, boots clanging over dropped tools and scattered forge-gear. The distant sounds of war were growing louder now ; not just horns, but the deep, metallic thunder of impact, the rumble of siege, and the howl of voices raised in fury.

The city gates loomed ahead ; high, fortified walls of bronze-laced stone, the gateway sealed tight with a lattice of iron-reinforced timber.

But it wasn’t the gate they were after.

Just to the right, a spiral staircase twisted upward into a tower carved from blackstone and bolted with steam vents and anchor chains. A watchtower, high above the walls ; with a view over the battlefield.

“C’mon,” Dallas said, already bounding up the steps one at a time.

“These steps are huge… like for giants” Panted Haoyu.

The climb felt endless, their legs burning, breath shallow. The air grew hotter with every step, the vibrations of the distant battle shaking the very walls.

And then ; they reached the top.

They stepped out onto the open platform, and their hearts froze.

Below them, spread out across a jagged plain of slag and ash, was war.

Real war.

![u8296664269_vast_battlefield_medieval_minotaurs_trebuchet_cat_91481f6f-3d96-4953-a7d0-532204892201_3.png](Chapter%2022%20-%20Ferron/u8296664269_vast_battlefield_medieval_minotaurs_trebuchet_cat_91481f6f-3d96-4953-a7d0-532204892201_3.png)

<A trebuchet fires debris and shrapnel as the war rages on>

Not a dreamlike metaphor. Not some surreal memory puzzle. This was full-blown, brutal medieval carnage; and it was alive.

The city of Ironheart had unleashed hell.

Across the battlefield, two massive Rhonza armies clashed in a thunderous storm of steel and flame.

Trebuchets, fashioned from wrought-copper and bonewood, hurled molten boulders the size of wagons across the field. They landed in plumes of fire, crushing warriors and turning earth to glass.

Catapults launching cauldrons of molten metals, flinging them like a water balloons across the plains, exploding onto soldiers who screamed in agony as they literally melted into the ground.

Arrow carts; rolling ballistae mounted with dozens of bows; launched synchronized hailstorms of metal spears that darkened the sky before raining death on the opposing army.

Rhonza skinning each other alive, decapitations, limbs hacked off, skulls bashed in… it was a horrific sight to behold.

The opposing force ; a rival Rhonza faction with imperial-blue painted armor and turquoise threaded emblems waving from battle standards ; had their own elite warriors, siege engines, hurling serrated spires and shattering the earth with rupture explosives that left glowing cracks in the terrain. 

A massive enemy steam engine tank rolled onto the field, blasting an artillery shell into a pit of skirmish, disintegrating Rhonza into ground meat infused with metal, sending ripped apart bodies flying like ragdolls across the sky. 

Haoyu and Dallas watched as the elite red-armored battalion ; the same soldiers that had marched past them in the market ; surged forward like a menacing living machines.

Their massive battle axes split bodies in half. Their furnace-swords carved smoking trails through enemy formations. One of them windmilled with a warhammer, spinning through a crowd of blue-armored warriors like a pendulum of judgment.

![480805835_122228208596031351_2828057899386139952_n.jpg](Chapter%2022%20-%20Ferron/480805835_122228208596031351_2828057899386139952_n.jpg)

The noise was unbearable.

The battle cries. The agonizing screams. The crunch of metal. The clanking of swords against shields and plates. The firing and exploding of artillery. The guttural cries of Rhonza warriors dying for causes that Haoyu and Dallas didn’t even begin to understand.

“Jesus Christ…” Haoyu whispered, gripping the edge of the tower wall.

Dallas was speechless. Eyes wide. Jaw tight.

Haoyu leaned over the edge.

His breath caught.

Eyes widened.

Jaw slackened.

And something inside him ; deep in his spine ; shivered.

Dallas noticed.

“You alright, partner? All this war is too much ain’t it?” he asked, edging closer.

Haoyu didn’t answer.

He just raised a trembling hand… and pointed.

Dallas followed his gaze.

And froze.

There, at the center of the battlefield, in the blood-slicked heart of the chaos, stood something that did not belong.

Not a Rhonza. Not an Oc’Xari. Not a human.

Not anything of this world.

It stood atop a pile of broken bodies ; as if it had emerged from the carnage, birthed from slaughter.

A towering flesh-beast, its skin bloated and pus-slicked, bulging in places like it was filled with rotting gas. It stood on three legs, crooked and unnaturally jointed, with two massive arms, long enough to drag against the ground ; the hands a fusion of hoof and claw.

Its head was unmistakably in the shape of a **pig.**

Tusks curled forward from a snouted mouth that did not breathe ; and horns jutted from its scalp, not symmetrical, not organic, but warped like melted iron.

Its eyes ; if you could call them that ; were holes, black and bottomless, fixed directly on Haoyu and Dallas.

It wasn’t thrashing. It wasn’t rampaging.

It was still and silent, like a statue, from over 100 meters away, watching Haoyu and Dallas.

“No...” Haoyu muttered, voice shaking. “No, that’s impossible.”

Dallas stepped back, instinctively clutching his chest ; as if the thing had already reached it’s presence inside him.

He swallowed hard.

“That’s the Pig I saw… back in the saloon on Nhexus…”

Dallas backed toward the wall of the tower, eyes locked to the pit.

“It’s looking right at us.”

The beast didn’t move.

**But suddenly Everything else… stopped.**

The chaos of war ; the clashing of steel, the cries of pain, the roar of catapults ; halted.

Rhonza soldiers froze mid-strike, blades locked in the air.

Smoke stopped rising.

Embers stopped flickering.

The wind stopped blowing.

The entire battlefield went dead ; like someone had pressed pause on reality.

Only the Pig remained animate.

Still staring.

Still watching.

Dallas didn’t breathe. Neither did Haoyu.

And then

The voice came.

It didn’t echo.

It didn’t vibrate through air.

It pounded through their bones.

A voice so low, so thunderous, it felt like it came from beneath the world, dragging fire and ash in its wake.

"You do not belong here mortal."

The sky above them darkened unnaturally.

A pressure fell on their chests, like invisible chains.

"You chase stars and scratch at doors that were never meant to open."

The Pig still hadn’t moved.

But the voice… was coming from it.

Through it.

Or from something inside it.

"You mortals are meddling in business beyond your comprehension."

"You scoured Nhexus. You opened the gates. Now the door opens both ways."

Haoyu's knees buckled. He hit the floor of the tower with a thud.

Dallas stumbled back, one hand gripping the railing, his knuckles white.

"You prod the bones of what came before the first spark."

"There are forces older than light."

"Older than the seed of life. Older than the silence that birthed the stars."

A pause.

Then, colder, quieter, somehow closer:

"You have seen far too much for the mortal eye."

A pause.

A tremor in the sky.

And then

With rage that could split worlds, the voice snarled:

"Now… **GET OUT OF MY REALM**."

### IV. Swift Current Ranch - 4:21 AM

Haoyu jerked awake, gasping for breath.

His chest heaved like he’d just been pulled from a freezing lake.

His shirt clung to his skin, drenched in sweat. Beside him, his wife stirred groggily, murmuring his name in concern ; but he couldn’t speak yet.

He sat upright on the makeshift bedroll, heart pounding.

The smell of hay. Wood. A sliver of moonlight through the window. The real world.

But it didn’t feel real.

Across the room, just outside the faint glow of the nightlight… someone was watching him.

Dmitry.

Seated in the kitchen chair, facing him silently. Still. Pale.

His tablet; covered in analog sensors, antennae, and etched coil rings ; hummed quietly in his lap, lit with dozens of warning glyphs.

Haoyu blinked, trying to get words out.

Dmitry stood slowly.

“You were gone for a while,” he said, voice hushed and flat.


“Two hours. Maybe more.”

Haoyu’s throat was dry.

“...Gone?” he croaked.

Dmitry didn’t blink.

“There was something standing over you the whole time. Shadow... thin. Elongated. Same morphology we saw on Nhexus in the crater footage from Echofall Day 76.”

Haoyu stared at him.

Dmitry continued:

“It never moved. It just… touched your head. Watched you.”
” I sat down on this chair, and it glanced at me- started watching me.”


“I watched it back.”

“We didn’t speak. And there was no aggression, just watching each other.”

He stepped slightly closer, lowering his voice:

“At one point, you were squirming, and it looked at me, and it looked like it was touching it’s temple, and trying to communicate something to me - it didn’t seem evil in it’s intent, seemed like it was trying to show you something.”

Haoyu rubbed his face, trembling.

“I saw it.”

Dmitry tilted his head.

“What did you see?”

Haoyu nodded, then exhaled shakily.

“I was on this planet called Ferron. A whole world of iron and flame. There was a battle. Massive. Ancient. Terrifying.”

He paused.

Then, voice low and rattled:

“And in the middle of it all… I saw it again. The same pig-like thing from another dream I have back on Nhexus. But instead of in the Saloon, the Pig was standing on a mound of corpses. It didn’t fight. Didn’t move. Just… watched us.”

Dmitry remained still.

“Did it do anything?”

“Yeah, it spoke to us this time” Haoyu whispered.

He looked down, breath shallow.

“It told us we’d seen too much. That the map… wasn’t meant for us. That something older than life itself was watching now. And then it screamed; told us to get out.”

Dmitry slowly sat back down.

“They’ve followed us through the data. Through the probe. Through the signal. Now… through the dreams.”

He looked out the window at the prairie moonlight.

“Echofall wasn’t just a project.”

“It opened a door to another world, and now it’s left wide open.”

Haoyu’s voice trailed off.

He sat still for a long moment, trying to hold onto the last flickers of that infernal battlefield ; the warmth of the forge winds, the piercing silence that followed the beast’s command.

Dmitry stood slowly, the faint chime of his device now rising in pitch ; the interface blinking with overlapping coordinate arcs and waveforms, displayed in holographic pulses across the cracked screen.

He tapped the side of it, pulled up the map.

And there it was.

A line.

A glowing trajectory slashing through the simulated cosmos of known and hypothesized systems ; originating somewhere just beyond Ferron’s modeled cluster. The endpoint?

A bright coordinate blip hovering in Haoyu’s region of the bed.

Dmitry turned the screen toward him.

“The moment you entered REM,” he said, voice steady, “this device began capturing... a transmission.”


“Not radio. Not subspace. Something deeper. Something laced into particle resonance.”

He paused, then clarified:

“Your mind ; your body ; was generating an emission.”


“The map registered it. The same kind of pulse signature as the Oc’Xari guitar when we analyzed it yesterday.”

“But this time… there was a destination ping.”

He tapped the glowing node.

“Ferron. Not metaphorically. Not in dream logic. Literally, physically, cosmologically real. Your consciousness made contact with a fixed location in space.”

Haoyu blinked.

“We... projected?”

Dmitry nodded once.

“Like quantum resonance through folded memory-space. Your brain is being used like a tuning fork ; like an anchor. Something out there is pulling you in, using the guitar’s signature as a conduit.”

He flicked to another screen ; jagged spikes of frequency activity.

“You weren’t imagining the battlefield. Or the Pig-Beast. Or the city.”


“Those places exist.”

“And Oc’Xari entity ; is bringing you there, like its trying to show you something.”

He looked back up, face pale but unwavering.

“These aren’t dreams, Commander.”


“They’re transits.”

Haoyu’s stomach sank.

“So when it said we weren’t supposed to be there…”

Dmitry’s expression tightened grimly.

“It meant it. Whatever this is ; it’s more ancient than Oc’Xari, more dangerous than anything Echofall imagined. You’ve been seen, Haoyu.”

He looked toward the hallway.

“And if it’s watching us in our own sleep…”


“…it’s already here.”

# Chapter 23 - The Donkey

---

### I. **Day 2 & 3: The Lab, The Ranch, The Raid and The Mystical Six Legged Donkey**

The morning after the Ferron dream, the crew gathered in the barn around Dmitry’s tablet -reviewing everything.

Frequency patterns. Energy waves. Gravitational bleed.

Dmitry’s voice was calm but firm as he ran them through it all:

“This wasn’t just a dream. There were emissions. Echoes in the Schumann resonance bands. I charted it. We can triangulate the entrypoint.”

Haoyu rubbed his temple, exhausted and electrified all at once.

“So this… Ferron… was real. We were there.”

Dmitry didn’t answer. He just tapped the map ; a faint glowing line drawn from Earth to a coordinate far outside the Kuiper Belt.

---

By 10:00 AM, the crew had split up into work roles.

Steven took the rental car, heading into Swift Current for bulk gear ; monitors, folding tables, ethernet spools, surge batteries, and whatever sleeping gear the local stores had.

Yuyan took Dallas’ F1 truck, cruising slow and steady down the dusty roads with a shopping list of his own ; conduit wire, microwave components, copper spools, and antenna tubing. He said he could probably make a satellite uplink “if given some foil and enough faith.”

Dallas handed him some gas money and pointed him to the old supply road into town.

“Try not to get pulled over. Pretty sure that truck’s got 1949 plates.” Dallas remarked.


 “But she sings.” Yuyan replied.

---

The rest of the day was spent building.

The barn filled with the sound of drills, bolt-tighteners, and the occasional "ow!" from Steven when he dropped a battery on his foot.

Desks were rigged up. A generator wired to solar input.

By sundown, the workspace felt like a command center.

Evening came. Dinner was quiet, filled with subdued jokes and tired glances.

The stars twinkled over the prairie sky.

No dreams that night.

---

Day 3 came peacefully.

The kids ran around the farmhouse, sword-fighting with twigs, shrieking with laughter.

Dallas handed out chore duties with a half-serious smirk.

“If y’all are settin’ up shop here, you’re gonna earn your keep.”

Pragnya mucked out the goat pen.

Dmitry helped replace a fence panel.

Steven rode a tractor for the first time in his life and absolutely loved it.

Haoyu stood on the porch beside his wife, arm draped around her shoulders, watching it all unfold.

“It’s not much,” he said.


“It’s everything,” she replied.

Dinner that night was beans, bread, and quiet contentment.

Another night passed.

Another peaceful, dreamless night.

---

### II. Detainment

**Day 4** - 5:03 AM.

The sun hadn’t yet crested over the frost-tipped fields. The barn lights were off. The wind was still.

Until the pounding came.

Loud. Repetitive. Unrelenting.

BANG. BANG. BANG.

“Open the door! POLICE! OPEN UP!”

Children screamed.

Dallas was already halfway down the stairs, hair a mess, reaching to open the front door.

“Hold on! What in god’s-”

The door exploded inward, smashing into Dallas’s chest like a battering ram. It launched him across the kitchen, sending him sprawling over a stool and shattering the coffee table.

**Flashbang**.

A white-hot burst of light and sound detonated in the center of the living room, rattling the very bones of the house.

Haoyu dove instinctively to shield his children, but it was too late ; the shockwave flooded everything. His ears rang like artillery. Vision fractured into afterimages. His kids shrieked in confusion.

“Get on the floor! Hands where we can see them!”

Heavy boots thundered in. Muffled radio commands. Lasers sweeping across every surface. Automatic rifles raised. Every movement barked at. Every voice drowned in chaos.

Before Haoyu could utter a word, he was wrenched to the floor, arm twisted behind his back, metal clicking into place around his wrists.

“Commander Zhang, you’re under federal detainment pending investigation of interstellar trafficking, fraudulent claims unauthorized alien contact, failing to appear in the court of law, and obstruction of classified research property.”

“You have no jurisdiction here!” Dmitry shouted somewhere across the room.

A rifle slammed into his spine. The primary CIA officer pulls out a scroll reading; Certification of Approved Investigation by the Government of Canada

“We do now, bitch.”

---

The barn lab ; still half-finished, computers all over the place, half loaded into server racks, cables still exposed, coffee cups still half full from the night before; was immediately surrounded.

Agents in black paramilitary suits stormed the threshold, sweeping with sensors, placing seizure tags on:

- The alien guitar, carefully unwrapped and zipped into a triple-sealed biohazard box.
- All laptops, antennae, and monitoring relays
- Even the custom chairs Yuyan and Steven had spent all day building from scrap

Inside the garage, the 1950 Ford F1 - shining like a dream from another century - was marked “PROPERTY OF JAMES BETHOZ // INTERDIMENSIONAL ASSET TRACKING.”

The plate was removed.

The keys, confiscated.

---

The entire crew ; Haoyu, Dmitry, Pragnya, Steven, Yuyan ; were marched out individually, still in their pajamas or half-dressed, blinking under the glare of helicopter lights and drone cameras circling overhead. 

Dallas - barely conscious and probably had a few ribs broken - hauled off into a separate police truck

Haoyu’s wife clutched their kids close, crying, screaming at the soldiers.

“He didn’t do anything! He’s a scientist! Our kids; our kids are terrified!”

They were separated.

The children were led into a white unmarked car. His wife, tear-streaked and trembling, shoved into the passenger seat of a different cruiser, fighting to keep her eyes on Haoyu.

“Don’t let them take you,” she sobbed. “Don’t you disappear on us.”

Haoyu was thrown into the back of an armored transport, his face pressed against the cold metal bars.

The drive to the facility felt like it took forever.

---

### **III. Processing**

Each crew member was placed in a separate, isolated holding cell ; no communication. No contact.

Bright white lights. Metal benches. Walls so sterile they hurt the eyes.

Interrogations began one by one.

---

**Ex Commander Haoyu Zhang - Former Lead of Project Echofall**

He was left in the room for nearly an hour.

No clock.

No sound.

Just the soft hum of fluorescent light and the faint static crackle from the observation glass.

When the door finally opened, two men in black suits entered ; crisp, cold, zero insignia. Not even nametags. One carried a tablet. The other, a steel briefcase he never opened.

They sat across from him. No greeting. No handshake.

Just the questions.

Agent:

“Commander. Why did you run from court?”

Haoyu exhaled slowly.

“I had leads to uncover mysteries beyond what humanity has ever encountered, I was chosen, we don’t even know why! We could reopen the project and bring more evidence to my case in my defence!”

Agent:

“Why did you take a team of laid-off government scientists to a different country to follow an alien signal?”

Haoyu:

“Because I’ve spent half my life chasing signals from a dead planet. And when one of those signals points at your dreams, your house, your wife ; you follow it.”

Agent:

“Where did you get the truck?”

Haoyu:

(Dry laugh)


“I have no idea how it got here. I don’t even know how to drive it properly.”

Agent:

“Where did the guitar come from?”

Haoyu:

“Dallas said an Oc’Xari just showed up and gave it to him.”

Agent:

“What is the function of the forge-world you referenced in your notes?”

Haoyu leaned forward.

Eyes sharp.

“It’s not a simulation. It’s not just a world. Ferron is a real place ; a whole planet ; we were *placed* on it, through some astral projection energy.”


“These aren’t hallucinations. They’re interdimensional correspondence. It’s like remoting into a computer*.*”

Agent:

“Who, or what- is the Pig Entity?”

Haoyu's voice faltered for the first time.

A pause.

“...I don’t know.”


“I don’t have evidence yet, but I don’t think it’s from Ferron or Nhexus, and it’s not an Oc’Xari.”

Agent:

“Is it a weapon?”

Haoyu:

“I have no idea what it is.”

Agent:

“Are you a threat?”

Haoyu met their eyes. Calm now.

“no, of course not.”


“The Echofall probe didn’t just find life. It woke something up. And now, you’re asking me if I’m the threat? I’m trying to figure it out!”

---

**Dmitry Alexeyev - Lead Systems Engineer, Russian immigrant**

Agent:

“You were on the original Echofall design committee, correct? The backbone of the signal intelligence platform?”

Dmitry: *(grunts, cold and unimpressed)*

“Ya. I built the backbone. Fed it iron and fire for twenty years while your politicians cut its legs off with red tape and cowardice.”

Agent:

“And you’re claiming the dreams emit quantifiable signals?”

Dmitry: *(leans in, knuckles cracked, voice rough as rusted steel)*

“You listen now. I fought in the Kholm Petrovski battle in Siberia when I was seventeen. Then I built battlefield comms for five governments across three wars. I don’t ‘claim.’ I measure. I log. I triangulate. I have monitoring tools that record actual, repeatable, mathematical data ; measurable waveform bursts, localized field anomalies, synchronized cerebral pulse events.”

Agent:

“What about the entity you claimed to observe in the room?”

Dmitry: *(snorts with fury)*

“Not ‘claimed,’ you imperial idiot. We photographed that shadow thing with the Echofall rover on Nhexus thirteen years ago. We have hard data, real footage, logs signed by your own military subcontractors. I sat three hours watching it stare into the rovers camera. Meanwhile, your analysts were jerking off in fancy offices, not doing shit!”

Agent:

“You could’ve reported it”

Dmitry: *(cuts him off, ice in his tone)*

“I did. Forty-seven times. Every time? Buried. Redacted. Reassigned. You can probably check your fucking emails and find my submissions.”

---

**Pragnya Reddy - The Systems Engineer and Biologist** sat with arms crossed, still wearing the same hoodie from the farm ; dark circles under her eyes, but spine straight. She didn’t flinch when the agents walked in.

Agent:


“You’re the one who re-validated the genome sequencing on the Nhexus samples?”

Pragnya:


“Three times. Independently. In two separate labs. Every nucleotide pattern matched LUCA identifiers within 0.003% variance.”

Agent:


“So you’re claiming life on Earth and life on Nhexus share a common ancestor?”

Pragnya:


“No. I’m proving it.”

Agent:


“You think that justifies violating international data sovereignty and collaborating with fugitives?”

Pragnya: (shrugs)


“I followed the data. It didn’t stop at borders.”

Agent:


“And the guitar? The dreams?”

Pragnya:


“We don’t have the answers to that- we are trying to discover what they mean.”

---

**Steven Young - The Swamp Redneck**, still in shorts and his ridiculous cowboy hat, just smirked through half the interview.

“I told you folks I just came to help build a lab. Y’all didn’t say there’d be no moonshine and only jail time.”

Agent:

“You flew from Florida to rural Saskatchewan to build a lab around an alien guitar?”

Steven: *(grinning like he’s about to sell a used tractor)*

“Well I didn’t come for the weather, that’s for damn sure. Cold up here like a gator’s ass in a snowstorm. But yeah, Dallas called. Said there was a magic guitar and possible interdimensional bullshittery, so I packed my boots and scanners and hopped on a plane.”

Agent:

“Bullshittery isn’t a scientific term.”

Steven: *(shrugs)*

“Ain’t got time for textbooks when the dream gods are flingin’ folks across space-time. I saw that map glow like a bass tracker sonar on meth. Whatever’s in that wood? It ain’t human.”

Agent:

“You understood the risks of harboring a possibly illegal extraterrestrial object?”

Steven: *(snorts)*

“Buddy, I once duct-taped a live possum to a lightning rod just to measure atmospheric ion surges. You think I care about what the fuckin feds call ‘legal’?”

Agent:

“Did you experience any of these ‘dreams’?”

Steven: *(leans forward, dead serious)*

“Not yet. But I ate a whole bag of Canadian trail mix and slept next to the damn thing for two nights. If I start foaming or speakin’ Latin backwards, I give you consent for exorcism.”

Agent: *(rubbing temples)*

“What’s your formal academic training?”

Steven: *(grinning)*

“Florida Institute of Computer Automation. Class of 2504. CS Bachelors degree. Valedictorian, technically. Long story.”

---

**Yuyan Chan - The Honorable Engineer**

Yuyan sat with his legs crossed, hands still cuffed. He gave a small nod as the agent entered ; polite, but unimpressed.

Agent:


“Dr. Chan. You were part of the first manned rover-linked observation team on Nhexus?”

Yuyan: (nodding slowly)


“I was in the first remote-pilot module. We mapped the riverbeds and sediment layers around the southern equator trench. That’s where we found the fossilized structures.”

Agent:


“The structures your team claimed were artificial?”

Yuyan:


“I didn’t ‘claim.’ I presented photos, density scans, and magnetic field aberrations. You buried the report under six years of NDA glue.”

Agent:


“You were also the one who reported… a ‘presence’ near the obsidian fault?”

Yuyan: (pauses ; thoughtful)


“Yeah. Felt like something was watching through the cameras. Back then I thought it was stress. But I saw it again. At the ranch, we got evidence, I can show you.”

Agent:


“What exactly did you see?”

Yuyan: (leaning forward just slightly)


“It had a face like a pig. But it wasn't a pig. It felt… wrong. Like light bent around it.”

Agent:


“And you still agreed to travel across the country with the fugitives?”

Yuyan: (softly, in Mandarin)


“如果你看见真理了，就不能假装没看见。”

*(“If you’ve seen the truth, you can’t pretend you haven’t.”)*

---

**Dallas Red — Civilian, Ranch Owner, “Unauthorized Harboring of Federal Fugitives”**

Dallas sat hunched, one arm cradling his side. The agents hadn’t offered him water. Or ice. Just fluorescent lights and questions. His right eye was swollen, his left cheek stained with dried blood. Still, he sat with his hat on the table… not in surrender, just out of stubborn respect.

Two agents entered. No insignia.

Agent 1:


“You’ve got a long record of unconventional behavior, Mr. Red.”

Dallas: (groaning slightly)


“You got a badge or a name, or am I just talkin’ to ghosts now?”

Agent 2: (ignores him)


“You housed at least a dozen individuals on your property during the early invasion hysteria of 2532. Families. Tech workers. Alleged ‘refugees.’ You positioned it as a sanctuary.”

Dallas: (spits blood off his lip)


“They weren’t ‘alleged’ nothin’. Their homes were dangerous due to all the riots back then. I gave ‘em food, a roof, and quiet. The government gave ‘em warnings and curfews.”

Agent 1:


“And the truck?”

Dallas: (blinks through the concussion, eyes drifting)


“Showed up in my driveway. With plates. Keys in the seat. It’s insured to a guy who owns half of California. Figured it wasn’t mine, but it sure as hell wasn’t stolen.”

Agent 2:


“James Bethoz reported it missing three years ago.”

Dallas:


“Then maybe ask him about the interstellar entity that dropped it off with a damn glowing guitar.”

Agent 1:


“That guitar is a protected anomaly now. You claim it appeared after the alien contact?”

Dallas: (leaning back with a slow wince)


“No. The alien waltzed into my barn, handed me a guitar and asked me for a shot of whiskey.”

Agent 2: (stepping closer)


“Are you saying you’ve had direct contact with an Oc’Xari emissary?”

Dallas: (still holding his ribs, eyes glazed)


“I didn’t say that. But if you happen to interact with one… Tell it I need new hinges and a front door… since SOMEBODY kicked it open…”

Agent 1:


“Why’d you hide the guitar?”

Dallas:


“Because I have no idea what it’s capable of.”

Agent 2:


“What do you know about it?”

Dallas:


“It sounds great, has some map on it, and some technology… we’re trying to figure it out… and we could use your help.”

A long silence followed. One of the agents scribbled notes.

“Bastards cracked my rib and …trying to say I’m a kidnapper?! What the Hell…”

Agent 1:


“How did you meet former Commander Haoyu Zhang?”

Dallas smirked, eyes still puffy and blood-crusted.

Dallas:


“In a dream.”

*(beat)*

“It’s like the aliens connected us in dream world… a Saloon in the middle of nowhere. Aliens line dancing. Six-legged donkey playin’ with kids. Real spiritual stuff.”

The agents didn’t blink.

Agent 2:


“You’re not taking this seriously.”

Dallas: (shrugging slightly)


“Oh, I am. That’s actually how we met. Showed up four or five times. Then one day he’s just... standing in the café. In real life.”

*(grinning faintly)*

“Either I’m nuts, he’s nuts, or we both caught the same fever dream from somethin’ off-planet.”

Agent 1:


“So your story is... he appeared to you in a dream.”

Dallas: (dryly)


“Yup. But don’t worry ; I got a concussion, not brain damage. I know how it sounds. You already got my fingerprints and blood on file. Might as well add my dreams while you’re at it.”

---

### **Interrogation: Haoyu’s Wife - Civilian, Mother of Two**

Agent:

“Ma’am, were you aware your husband was skipping his court date?”

Wife: *(tired, composed)*

“Yes.”

Agent:

“Did he ever show signs of instability?”

Wife: *(glances sideways)*

“He was a dedicated government employee! He worked 20 hard years for you! You have no appreciation for his hard work and dedication!”

Agent:

“Why did you follow him here?”

Wife: *(quietly)*

“Because for the first time in years... he actually came home from work. And we were together.”

---

### **Interrogation: Haoyu’s Children**

Agent: *(kneeling)*

“Hey there, can I ask you something? Did Daddy talk about aliens?”

Daughter:

“Nuh-uh. He just helped us with homework and played Lego with us.”

Agent:

“Do you know what your daddys job is?”

Son : *(clutching his dino toy)*

He mumbled, fearfully - in truth “He’s a Hero”

### Legal Outcomes – 2540

By the time the international tribunal closed the books on what media branded *“The Saskatchewan Cult Incident,”* the lives of everyone involved had been shattered beyond recognition.

---

### **Pragnya Reddy** and Yuyan **Chan**

Both were deported back to the United States within 48 hours of questioning. Their responses had been polite, composed, and minimally incriminating ; but insufficient to escape scrutiny.

They were issued felony charges under U.S. Code 18 § 2332f for *“providing technical assistance in unauthorized cross-border paramilitary infrastructure with potential extraterrestrial conspiracy.”*

Though the charges were inflated and paper-thin, they stuck.

Both were placed under probationary supervision, assigned digital parole officers, and barred from working in any scientific field for a minimum of 10 years.

They left Canada with bruised reputations ; and a smoldering resentment towards Haoyu, Dmitry and Steven, whose bombastic interrogations had only made things worse for the team.

---

### **Steven Young** and Dmitry Alexeyev

The Canadian court deemed them “aggressively non-compliant” and classified their behavior as "technologically subversive with potential for retaliatory communication leaks.”

Their charges included:

- **Unlicensed signal broadcasting**
- **Refusal to comply with subnational authority**
- **Suspected hoax perpetration with intent to incite unrest**
- **Conspiracy to breach aerospace radio silence codes**

They were quietly transferred to a low-security facility in Georgia, where they would serve close to 3 years in prison, mostly to keep them quiet and contained.

Their pleas for appeal were ignored.

---

### **The Children**

Removed immediately from their mother’s custody during the raid, the two minors were flown under sealed identity to a state-run youth containment center in Sacramento, California.

Though no charges were filed against them, the official report cited “emergency protection due to exposure to psychologically destabilizing environments and cult-like activity.”

They were renamed in the system and barred from any contact with either parent until age 18.

---

### **The Wife**

She was placed under an emergency psychiatric hold in a Manhattan facility, initially for “post-traumatic disassociation” and later reclassified under Section 12.7 for *“paranoid delusion and alien-induced psychosis.”*

Despite a clean mental health history, the decision was non-negotiable.

Her screams when they took the kids echoed in the hallway until the padded door closed.

---

### **Dallas Red**

The court declared him an extreme threat to civil society.

The charges included:

- Theft of a historic private asset valued at $11.7 million (the 1950 Ford F1)
- Criminal asylum and kidnapping of 17 displaced families during global emergency
- Aiding and abetting a fugitive war criminal (Haoyu)
- Possession and concealment of high-risk alien artifacts

They did not care about the dreams.

They did not care that the guitar had no discernible military function.

They didn’t care that he actually helped the families- they just had a narrative to fulfill.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole in Canada’s Dollard Maximum Security Facility.

His only words during sentencing:

“This is fucking bullshit.”

---

### **Commander Haoyu Zhang**

Once the face of *Echofall*, now branded the architect of mass manipulation and the root cause behind World War 5 - essentially being labeled as Adolf Hitler of the 26th century.

<All blame, responsibility and accountability of all wrong doings of the world since the the Oc’Xari invasion was put onto the Commander - the scapegoat - the savior of Earths sins.>

His sentence:

- 10 years in isolation
- Followed by state-executed termination
- Shipped out and locked up in a windowless, 5 x 4 foot steel containment cell beneath Angola Supermax Facility in Louisiana

Officially, they held him responsible for:

- Provoking World War 5
- Instigating the global taxation wave under false alien pretenses
- Orchestrating an international disinformation network
- Defying a court-mandated appearance
- Evading prison sentence
- Smuggling foreign nationals and prohibited technology
- The kidnapping of his wife, kids, and his fellow crew
- Unlawful reactivation of Level-3 banned extraterrestrial telemetry systems

They called it justice.

They said it would bring peace.

But ironically the only peace was the quiet EON-7b rover on Nhexus

### I. **Prison, Silence, and What’s Left**

### Dmitry Alexeyev (AKA *Lex*)

The first few nights in the Low Security Detainment Block passed without sleep. Dmitry stared at the ceiling of his bare concrete cell, its single dim light flickering like a dying filament.

He didn’t speak for two days.

Not during processing. Not during medical. Not when the guards shoved him paperwork with the words *“Sign for your belongings.”* He just stared.

But on the third morning ; at lunch, Steven Young’s unmistakable voice shouted across the mess hall.

“Hey, Joseph Stalin! You still alive over there?”

Dmitry didn't laugh. Just his eyes twitched towards the source.

By shower time, Steven had shuffled into the stall next to him, soap in one hand, leaning over the divider with that crooked grin of his.

“Ain’t this just a fine goddamn mess?”


“We wanted to play aliens, and now we’re buck-naked in a concrete Motel 6 for terrorists.”

Dmitry finally muttered.

“The government betrayed us. They betrayed all of us...”

“Yeah,” Steven sighed, pressing his forehead to the cool tile. “They really did. After all we fucking accomplished.”

Neither man had family listed in the visitor logs. Neither had legal teams still fighting. They both knew what this was now:

Not justice.

Not rehabilitation.

Silence. Banishment. Decay.

### **Dallas Red**

**Cell 041-D** in the high-security wing of Calgary Central Correctional was windowless. A slab of cold concrete for a bed. Fluorescent light overhead that never shut off.

Dallas sat hunched, clutching his ribs where the door had hit him.

They had reset the bone, but nothing could reset the betrayal.

The old rancher replayed every second of the last month. The coffee in the Chuckwagon Café. The laughter of the kids. The guitar under the tarp. The dreams that changed him.

“I did everything right,” he whispered to no one.

“I gave them a place. I fed 'em. I believed.”

But belief didn’t count in a courtroom. And truth, real truth ; had no lobbyists, no press agents, no government backers.

Dallas Red, once guardian of a miracle, was now just a number.

And he began to wonder:

“Were the dreams even real? Or did I just lose my whole damn life for a crazy hallucination?”

---

### **Haoyu Zhang**

He had stopped eating.

That wasn’t protocol ; so the guards began injecting nutrient gel into his arm once a day through the slot in his containment pod.

Commander Zhang… was gone.

There was only a broken man now; a ghost wrapped in skin, confined inside a stainless steel coffin.

He didn’t move.

He didn’t sleep.

He didn’t speak.

They had stripped everything ; his name, his dignity, his legacy ; leaving behind a hollow man with nothing but recycled air and the faint hum of fluorescent lights to remind him he still existed.

It was called a “cell,” but it was smaller than a broom closet. This was not prison. it was a place that makes hell look more desirable.

The walls pressed in with claustrophobia. The lights overhead never shut off, so he couldn't tell what time it was ; or even if time still mattered. His wrists were blistered from restraint bands. His thoughts? Flayed open by a guilt that never stopped whispering.

This was the man who once led humanity’s most ambitious interstellar mission.

The one who sent a rover to another world.

And in return?

He got his wife institutionalized.

His children abducted and scattered.

His friends imprisoned.

His crew condemned.

His home destroyed.

His family ; broken.

His reputation ; incinerated.

His purpose ; shattered into dust finer than the Nhexus soil they first tested on.

Haoyu sat, spine curled, cheek against the cold metal of his cot barely big enough for a dog to sleep on, which was only there **for HR to check an “ethical” box on a spreadsheet which required all prisoners to have a “bed”.

“I was supposed to be there for them.”

He mouthed the words, lips barely parting.

“I was supposed to give them a future.”

A laugh caught in his throat ; not humor, but something ragged and feral.

“I followed the stars... and led us straight into hell.”

His voice broke on the last syllable.

And somewhere in the back of his skull, buried under exhaustion and ruin, a whisper remained.

The memorial voice of the Pig, still echoing on;

“You don’t belong here mortal…
You scoured Nhexus. You opened the gates. Now the gates open both ways.
You have seen far too much for the mortal eye.”

And it was right.

He wasn’t meant to see any of it.

And now ; he was paying the price.

# Chapter 25 - Serica

### **I. Serica - The Living Threadscape**

**Day 1 of the Dream’s Return**

Dmitry awoke first.

But there was no cot beneath him. No damp concrete cell. 

There was only... warmth.

A deep, living warmth. Like sleeping on the chest of something enormous and kind.

He sat up slowly, stiff as rusted scaffolding. His hands reflexively reached for a sidearm he hadn’t worn in years. There was none. Just silk.

The ground beneath him wasn’t ground at all ; it was a woven bed of organic thread, softly undulating beneath him as if it breathed. It shimmered with colors too subtle for digital screens: muted violets, iridescent oranges, ghostlight blue. Every thread had its own story.

Above, the sky glowed in waves. Not with a sun, but with vast bioluminescent creatures ; skybeasts, their translucent fins catching the wind like sails, carrying enormous, spindly structures on their backs. Living buildings. Cities in motion.

Dmitry narrowed his eyes.

“Not simulation. Not hallucination.”

His voice was gruff, thick with the iron of his old world.

“Dream transmission... I’m remoted in.”

The air smelled like morning tea and wild flowers. Humid, yes ; but not oppressive. The kind of air that healed you just by breathing it.

Behind him came a voice ; low, confused, unmistakable.

“Uhhh... Lex?”


“The weather here is a lot better than back in Canada…”

Dmitry turned.

Steven Young, barefoot, shirtless, wrapped in what looked like a robe made of moss and spiderwebs, stumbled toward him like a hippie in California on mushrooms.

His hair was wild, his chest sunburned, and his expression dumbfounded.

“What the hell kinda Florida acid trip is this?”


“Did you put somethin’ in the mashed taters again?”

Dmitry didn’t answer.

He was crouching now, palms flat on the living thread-road beneath them ; feeling the pulse of it. It vibrated. Softly. Like a heartbeat made of harpstrings.

Steven knelt and poked the ground.

“It’s like carpet if carpet had a soul.”


“...Don’t tell me this is another alien planet.”

Dmitry stumbled on words in awe…

He rose to his full height ; slow, reverent ; like a soldier waking on sacred ground.

His eyes scanned the skyline: a sea of living architecture spilling down a slope of mist-draped jungle. But this wasn’t a jungle like Earth’s ; it was softer, gentler, a canopy of breathing color. Thick vines like braided silk swayed with magnificent textures.

In the valley below them, an enormous woven metropolis breathed.

Literally.

Every building moved.

Not in crumbles or creaks ; but like bellows, like slumbering giants stretching in slow rhythm. Homes, towers, plazas ; all of them *were* massive organisms made of fur, thread, and curled spools of living silk. Some strutted on insectile legs. Others slithered forward like millipedes made of yarn. A few were airborne ; floating by way of gliding wing-creatures latticed with semi-translucent domes that swayed like jellyfish.

Bridges weren’t built ; they were spun in real-time, some unraveling behind travelers, others spooling outward in anticipation of foot traffic.

And among them…

The Sylvers.

Hundreds ; no, THOUSANDS ; of tall, soft-bodied humanoids walked with poise and calm purpose. Their clothes shimmered like cloudlight. Their eyes were luminous and soft, trailing hues of rose-gold and indigo. Ears long and pointed, skin like pale woven bark or soft moss. Some of them trailed vibrating silk behind them, letting it float freely in the breeze with steeze.

Steven’s jaw fell slack.

“I’m not even high,” he whispered.


“And this is the prettiest damn place I’ve ever seen.”

Dmitry didn’t respond.

He stepped forward slowly, boots crunching on a path that wasn’t dirt ; it was some kind of embroidered organic tapestry. It shifted beneath his weight like it *knew* he was there.

Steven lowered his voice.

“Ain’t no way this is just a dream.”

Before Dmitry could form a response, he is distracted by a low ripple passed through the silk underfoot.

Dmitry stepped back.

The weave beneath him quivered, then began to grow ; fine strands of lustrous violet and ocean-blue silk rising like smoke, twisting, knitting, shaping.

From the ground, a figure emerged with threads coming together to knit a humanoid.

It unfurled like a tapestry come to life, rising to its full height with grace unlike anything mechanical. And when it stood before them, both Dmitry and Steven were struck speechless.

It looked… like them.

Or rather, like a living sculpture of them ; a gentle fusion of their silhouettes, the shape rough but unmistakable: Dmitry’s broad shoulders, Steven’s long jawline, a blend of human posture and Serican artistry. Its body flowed with intricate robes of royal silk, the folds shifting between deep indigo and moonlit purple, glimmering softly in the bioluminescent air.

Its face was masklike ; two almond-shaped threads forming hollow eyes. No mouth. No ears.

But it raised an arm toward them.

Then the arm unraveled, and from the wrist sprouted fingers ; not five… but seventeen.

They bloomed out in all directions like threaded antennae, twitching and shifting, folding and retracting like a confused origami spider. It paused. Then began retracting some. Adding others. Trying combinations. Nine fingers. Seven. Eleven.

Each permutation hovered in front of Dmitry, as if the being were saying:

Is this right? No? This? This?

Suddenly, the ground beneath Dmitry’s feet pulsed.

And then... it grew hair.

“What the f-!”

A gentle strand of thread, as thick as a vine and soft as down, slithered up around his boot, curling upward with curious tenderness, wrapping gently around his wrist.

Dmitry went rigid.

“Steven. I swear to god, if this is some dream-larva tryin’ to mate-”

“Relax, Lex!” Steven said, wide-eyed but fascinated. “It’s just givin’ you a little handshake. I think.”

The silk curled around Dmitry’s fingers... then paused, trembled once ; and released.

The woven figure, still in front of them, retracted its 17-fingered hand.

Then slowly, like a sculptor getting the proportions just right, it re-spun the fingers ; this time, into a perfect five-fingered human hand.

Identical to Dmitry’s.

It held it up.

Open. Still. A mirror of his own.

Dmitry’s breath caught in his throat.

Cautiously ; like approaching a bear instead of a being made of bedtime fabric ; he raised his hand, matching the gesture.

They stared at one another.

Human and Weaver.

Man and mimic.

Woven silence.

Then, from behind:

“I think he’s tryna learn how we talk,” Steven muttered, scratching his stomach. “Y’know. Like charades. But with… hand noodles.”

He tilted his head at Dmitry.

“So go on. Wiggle your fingers or somethin’. Show ‘im what it means when you flick someone off.”

Dmitry sighed.

“We are ambassadors to an alien civilization, Steven.”

“Yeah. And you’re the diplomat with the grumpy face.”

The silk figure didn’t move. Just waited ; hand raised ; patient as the stars.

Then, with a mischievous grin, Steven raised his hand and extended his middle finger proudly, like a kid showing off a secret weapon.

“Let’s see if he learns this one.”

Before Dmitry could stop him;

SLAP.

“Idiot,” Dmitry growled, swatting Steven’s hand down. “That’s not diplomacy.”

But it was too late.

The Weaver paused… processed…

And then raised its own shimmering silk hand ; one long, delicate thread forming into a singular extended middle finger, elegant and absolutely unmistakable.

Steven cackled and howled a malicious laughter, doubling over and wheezing into the warm breeze.

“He gets it! Oh my God. That’s it. I taught the alien thread-dude how to flip someone off. I’m basically a professor now!”

Dmitry pressed a hand to his face.

“We’re going to be woven into a prison mattress…”

Still trying to salvage dignity, Dmitry carefully held up the Peace salute ; two fingers parted in the middle.

The Weaver blinked ; if those hollow eyes *could* blink ; and, with graceful accuracy, reconfigured its hand into the same gesture. A perfect replication.

That was when they noticed the crowd.

Sylver.

Dozens of them now, slender and tall, like trees turned humanoid ; their gowns spun from rainfall, their hair flowing in soft braids of living moss and whisper-thread. They clustered around in silence, their glowing eyes watching the display with unreadable curiosity.

They whispered to one another in a soft harmonic language.

And then, one stepped forward.

An elder, perhaps. Or an archivist. Their robes were layered with knotted scrolls and woven glyphs that shimmered like dew.

In their long fingers, they carried a frame.

It looked like a window made of silk, stretched and embroidered into impossible clarity.

They turned it toward Dmitry and Steven.

And there, threaded in astonishing detail ; with texture and shading made from hair-thin strands ; was an image.

Of Haoyu.

Not a likeness.

Not an impression.

A portrait, lifelike as a high-resolution scan, right down to the scar on his brow and the tired storm in his eyes.

Steven’s laughter vanished.

Dmitry took a step forward, stunned.

“How…?” he whispered. “That’s him.”

The Sylver holding the frame nodded slowly ; then turned, and beckoned them, saying some weird alien words.

The message was clear:

Come with us.

The Sylver and their woven companions ; those graceful silk-beast humanoids ; began to move.

Not with urgency, but with purposeful grace, gliding across the living streets in rippling motion, like a sea of threads pulled by unseen hands. Their woven city bent and flexed around them ; roads unrolling, archways rising, canopies blooming open above their heads like breathing umbrellas of lace and light.

They moved quickly.

Dmitry and Steven… did not.

The two men stood dumbstruck, still processing the silk-framed portrait, still frozen in the amber of confusion.

Several Sylver turned to look back.

One tilted their head, giving a soft vibrational hum ; a signal, a call to patience.

And then; without warning; the ground beneath Steven and Dmitry bloomed.

A cluster of luxurious silk tendrils rose behind their knees, gently but firmly toppling them backward into what could only be described as an extravagant, mobile sofa. Pillowy, lush, iridescent, and absolutely alive.

“Whoa! Whoa whoa whoa-HEY!” Steven yelped, arms flailing before he landed squarely on the plush throne. “Well damn. This is... kinda nice.”

Dmitry tensed, half-rising; until the sofa beneath him murmured with warmth, adjusting to the shape of his spine.

“This city is sentient,” he muttered darkly. “Thread-based auto-transport. Biocognitive silk.”

“It’s a freakin’ sofa Uber,” Steven grinned, sinking deeper. “Alien Uber! I’m gettin’ used to this place already.”

### **II. The Dungeon**

---

The living chaise carried them effortlessly, gliding in sync with the crowd ahead. Every movement was smooth, flowing like a river of fabric beneath their bodies. The street bent to accommodate them. The air shimmered with gentle light from above, and melodic pulses echoed across the structures ; as if the whole city was singing quietly to itself.

And then… the melody shifted.

The road tilted, gently guiding their chariot toward something immense.

Before them loomed a megastructure ; This was a living masterpiece, a being of threads so vast and intricate it seemed to defy anatomy. A towering woven beast, shaped like an elephant, a jellyfish, and a floating temple all at once ; its limbs spiraled into spires, its tendrils curled into vaults and domes. Every fiber of its body was art ; mural upon mural, fractal upon fractal, like it had spent a thousand years learning to express every emotion it had ever felt through architectural design. Sorrow. Wonder. Longing. Joy.

It was alive. And it was beautiful.

The structure's enormous gates unfolded, not like doors ; but like a blossom, petals peeling open, revealing a shimmering interior beyond. The chariot did not pause. It floated forward without hesitation, carrying Steven and Dmitry inside the creature itself.

Downward.

A long, spiraling descent ; not steep, but steady ; taking them through corridors of glowing tapestries, woven memories, and humming resonant strands. For thirty full seconds they drifted down into the depths ; not far enough to feel buried, but far enough to forget the sky.

And then… it changed.

The silk gave way to stone.

Not carved, not shaped ; just natural earth. Rock. Dirt. Dust. The living architecture stopped precisely where the woven world ended. It wouldn’t go further.

The chariot settled, the silk forming steps to let them off.

Dmitry rose first.

“We’ve reached the true surface,” he muttered. “Everything above this… was tapestry.”

Steven followed, barefoot on the soil, scratching his ribs.

“So what, this is like… under the rug? Alien undercity sewers?”

Before them stood three Sylver ; one of them still clutching the silk portrait of Haoyu. The elf nodded once, and turned silently.

They were led on foot now ; across the raw bedrock of Serica itself. It wasn’t a cave. There were no walls. No ceilings. Just a strange, wide clearing ; a forgotten pocket beneath the living city, untouched by thread.

After a short walk… they reached it.

A cell.

But not bars.

No chains. No steel.

The prison before them was formed from the ribcage of a giant creature, long decayed. Bone-ivory, yellowed with time, arching into a cradle of solemn isolation. Ancient, fossilized vertebrae were woven into the perimeter ; as if something immense and wise had died here, and the world had repurposed its body into a cage.

Inside, slumped in the center of the bone-spun room…

Was Haoyu Zhang.

Unshaven. Eyes hollow. His body trembling in a way that suggested the tears had come long before they arrived ; and that agony wasn’t new to him. It had become his companion.

He did not look up.

He didn’t even react.

He just sat there.

Weeping.

A man whose soul had already split open.

And who had no words left to patch it shut.

---

They stood at the edge of the bone-prison.

Dmitry stepped closer, his boots crunching dust beneath him.

“Haoyu?” he said, voice low. “It’s me. Lex. We’re… here. Somehow.”

No response.

Steven knelt, waving a hand in front of the man’s face.

“C’mon now, Commander ; snap outta it. You're in the land of throw pillows and sky whales, partner.”

Haoyu didn’t blink.

Didn’t flinch.

Just… breathed.

A rhythm so mechanical, so hollow, it sounded like a simulation.

He was a soul with no fire left.

The echoes of the past year had consumed him completely.

Betrayal. Loss. Imprisonment. Shame.

And worst of all ; the belief that none of it had mattered.

That perhaps the Pig had been right.

That they should have never followed the map.

---

Dmitry turned, fury clenched in his jaw.

“Why is he locked up?” he demanded. “Why this? Why here?”

The Sylver holding the silk portrait stepped forward. His tone was soft, but his gestures were deliberate ; indicating the cage, then Haoyu, then to a sweeping motion that stretched far beyond the room.

“We don’t understand you,” Dmitry muttered. “But you… want us to follow you?”

The Sylver nodded.

They turned and began walking. The other two Sylver with them motioned for Steven and Dmitry to follow.

---

They retraced their steps, past the ribcage cell, back through the raw soil of Serica’s surface, up the woven staircase carved into the body of the megastructure.

As they reached the light again, the colors returned ; vibrant threads painting stories across every wall and ceiling, humming with ancient memory.

And waiting for them just outside the structure…

Was a thread vehicle unlike anything seen before.

It had no wheels, no visible propulsion ; just a long, woven shell, shaped like a beetle crossed with a gondola, fibers humming softly with internal vibration. The front opened like a flower.

They climbed inside.

It was cool. Cushioned. Almost womb-like.

And it moved ; gliding above the living streets, silently weaving the silk beneath them into new roadway as it passed. Every turn was elegant. Every structure they passed vibrated in recognition.

Then, in the distance, a new kind of structure emerged…

Something different.

Massive. Looming. Elegant. Ornate..

---

Outside, two guards stood.

Tall ; even for Sylver.

Their limbs were longer. Their features more angular. Their silk robes were darker, edged with blood-red strands and embossed with symbols that glowed faintly.

But what drew the eye was their weapons.

They weren’t swords. Or staffs. Or guns.

They looked like… scissors… sorta… huh.

And though the guards did not speak, they bowed.

They were expected, and treated as guests

# Chapter 26 - A New Language

They entered the woven structure with quiet reverence. The air inside felt denser, like being wrapped in warm fabric. The walls weren’t flat ; they *flowed*, as though slowly shifting under an invisible loom. Woven lamps glowed softly overhead.

The Sylvar guides ; graceful, silent ; led them down a hall into what resembled a study chamber. Scrolls and threadbound books lined curved bone-silk shelves. The books were strange ; woven from leathery cloth, their pages made of linen and bark, inked not with liquid but stitched in tight, flowing thread symbols.

One Sylvar stepped forward and handed them a particular book.

It was small. Short. Only a handful of pages.

A children’s book.

No repeated letters. Oversized glyphs. Each symbol was vivid, purposeful, and pulsing with some unknown logic. Even the cover was soft to the touch ; as if the book itself had once been alive.

Dmitry turned pages slowly.

Steven frowned, scratching his head.

“Ain’t got no idea what this says, but that ‘A’ lookin’ thing reminds me of a gator track I once saw in my cousin’s backyard.”

They studied it for over an hour. The Sylvar watched patiently, never interrupting.

Neither man was a linguist. But both were engineers, analysts. They’d spent decades interpreting sensor noise and alien telemetry.

They knew what they were looking at ; or at least, how to learn it.

“It’s a full alphabet,” Dmitry muttered.


“A logic system,” he added. “Mathematical spacing. Positional encoding. Vowel dynamics… It’s *teachable*.”

“Takes me back to decoding Second-Soviet numbers stations.” he added dryly.

“It’ll take months,” Steven said, squinting. “But we’ll get it.”

---

### **II. Guest Quarters**

As the woven sun dipped into the silk horizon, the Sylvar silently escorted them across a breezy walkway to a guest home ; an organic structure shaped like a beehive and lotus blossom combined.

Inside was warmth, food- like a plate of gelatin red berries, succulent tofu-like blocks of some strange alien plant and a bottle beholding exquisite flavors of honey, smoke, cedar, and blackberry. In the bedroom were two soft, body-molded living nests that adapted to their posture like memory-foam made of moss.

They sank in without resistance.

The air hummed softly.

Sleep took them without a fight.

---

### **III. Back in the Cells**

And just like that…

They woke up back in prison.

Cement. Metal bars. Bleached tile.

Steven blinked.

“Well damn. That was the nicest bed I’ve had since prom night in Tampa.”

---

### **#1: The Macaroni**

In the following weeks, no other dreams arose, but they started noticing patterns in their everyday.

At lunch, trays were slammed onto tables.

Dmitry was halfway into his mushy macaroni before he froze.

The pasta… was *arranged*.

Not stacked randomly. Not poured. But placed.

An unmistakable character ; one of the symbols from the children's alphabet book. It curved slightly left, like a sideways tree root.

Steven looked at his tray.

His beans were shaped like another symbol.

“Lex. My lunch is speakin’ Alien-Elvish.”

---

### **#2: The Wall Stain**

Another week gone by, as Dmitry sat on his cot, he noticed the stain on the wall beside his bunk.

It’s been there since the day he got in, unchanged.

But now he suddenly recognized it.

A thread letter ; faint, like it had been burned into the paint long ago.

---

### **#3: Reflections**

Some more time passed

Steven washed his hands in the sink after dinner. The smudges in the mirror above him… they connected in just the right way.

Another symbol.

A verb, maybe. Or a name.

He stared at it for too long.

---

### **#4: The Shower Scene**

On another prison morning, Steven shuffled into the communal shower.

Cold jail shower water. Muffled swearing. Cheap soap.

He cringed, ached and groaned as the cold water hit his back ; then squinted at the drain.

There it was.

A lone pubic hair, sitting perfectly curved, shaped exactly like the 9th letter in the silk alphabet.

Steven burst out laughing.

“LEX!” he shouted, echoing off the tile.


“THE ALIENS ARE WRITIN’ TO ME IN *BALL HAIR!*”

Someone three stalls over muttered, “Jesus Christ…”

---

Dmitry sat in his bunk, notebook open, pencil worn to the nub.

He had begun sketching the symbols ; all of them ; building a cross-reference. Correlations. Occurrences. Semantic geometry.

Steven leaned in from the next cell, chewing a plastic spoon.

“So… what if this is the aliens’ version of ABCs?”

Dmitry didn’t look up.

“Then we are kindergarteners,” he said.

“And the universe is finally teaching us how to speak.”

---

### **Day 492: The Return of the Dream**

It had been over a year and a half since the police raid back in Red’s ranch.

Since the prison walls swallowed them whole.

Since their first step on this silken alien world.

The alphabet of threads had become a secret language between Dmitry and Steven ; whispered over lunch trays, sketched in notebook margins, referenced in the most absurd of places. But as the months dragged on, even those symbols began to fade. Like dreams slipping behind a curtain of apathy.

By day 492, neither of them expected it to return.

But it did.

---

### **IV. Waking Under the Tree**

When the dream took them, it was gentle.

No jolt. No alarm. Just the smell of sun-warmed grass and a low breeze curling across skin.

Dmitry opened his eyes first, blinking against the soft golden light.

They were lying beneath a massive oak tree, its leaves rustling above like a lullaby in slow motion. The hill beneath them rolled into soft green folds ; like the Pennsylvania countryside in spring.

“Not thread,” Dmitry  murmured. “Not silk. Real… grass.”

Steven stirred beside him.

“Lex,” he whispered, shielding his eyes from the sun. “Is this heaven or West Virginia?”

Down the hill, a meadow rippled in the light. Pastures stretched lazily toward the horizon. At the base of the valley, small farmhouses dotted the landscape ; each one alive. Made not from wood or brick, but cotton beasts ; massive, gentle creatures with furlike structures that grew into domes and chambers.

Instead of roads, paths of woven reed and dirt trails snaked through the fields.

Forests of real trees bordered the landscape, and in their shade moved Sylver Elves ; not the ones from the Grand Nexus of silk from their initial dream, but simpler, earthier versions. They were barefoot, their robes made of coarse moss-fiber, hands full of berries, herbs, and cloth bundles.

As they spotted the humans, they would scatter, hide, and curiously watch.

[Chapter 27 - Countryside Chaos](Chapter%2027%20-%20Countryside%20Chaos%202d5fda674d6980cc8447d90b38ed5046.md)

---

# Chapter 27 - Countryside Chaos

The rural Sylver were not like their urban kin.

They didn’t attack. But their eyes were wide. Fearful. They hid behind tree stumps, disappeared into hollow dens beneath root systems, or clung to the sides of their cotton-beast homes, whispering into their coats to trigger camouflage. The beasts responded, sprouting shaggy layers of fur ; an attempt to blend into the fields.

It didn’t work.

But the effort was telling.

“We’re not welcome,” Dmitry muttered.

“Dunno,” Steven said, squinting. “I think we just spooked the hillbillies.”

He waved toward one of the beasts.

“Y’all ever see a poodle turn into a shed before? That one just became a damn blanket barn.”

---

### **VIII. The Road Signs**

They followed the nearest path down into the plain ; past anxious stares, rustling thickets, and twitching camouflage. The road forked several times, and at each intersection, a signpost stood tall ; made of bark and twine, with symbols woven directly into the knots.

Faint memory sparked in both men.

“Lex. These are letters.”

“Thread alphabet,” Dmitry confirmed, squinting. “But... fuzzy. I’ve forgotten half.”

“Same. It’s like it’s in the back of my head somewhere, just gotta dig it up.”

They stopped at a wide patch of dirt.

Dmitry grabbed a bush stick laying in the grass next to it. Steven knelt beside him.

Together, they re-drew the thread alphabet ; carving each symbol into the road with crude lines and muttered guesses.

Memory came in bursts.

A letter here. A pattern there.

It was like trying to reassemble a broken stained-glass window.

But after an hour of kneeling in the dust, joking about pubic hairs in the shower, wiping sweat from their brows, and arguing over symbol positions, they were almost there.

“This one’s the ‘S’ sound,” Steven said, pointing to a crooked hook.

“And this one’s… maybe a root glyph for ‘home.’”

“No, that one was the macaroni symbol. I remember ‘cause it looked like my Aunt Carla’s elbow noodle casserole.”

Dmitry chuckled ; the first time since the police raid.

---

Eventually, after squinting at their hand-scratched alphabet and matching the curves, hooks, and threads of each glyph to the ones woven into the signposts, Steven and Dmitry stood confidently beneath the tall wooden marker at the crossroads.

It pointed in five different directions ; each path winding off into fields, forest, or low hills.

They began to sound out the woven script aloud:

“Maa...lith-ren,” Steven said, frowning. “That’s what this one says.”


“That one says ‘Thesselvine,’” Dmitry muttered, translating the arch-loop script with his finger.

Another sign:

“Kaelum,” he said. “Sounds... elevated.”

“Ooo, this one’s got a squiggle like that shower hair symbol ; says Drolshan,” Steven added, nodding. “Probably haunted… which means it probably has answers!”

Dmitry half-ignoring it, proceeding to read the final sign:

“Nystral,” Dmitry read, blinking. “That sounds… familiar. But I don’t know why.”

They stood in silence for a moment.

Five signs. Five roads. Five cities they’d never heard of.

“So… which one takes us back to Haoyu in the ribcage jail cell?” Steven asked.

“We never knew what the first place was even called,” Dmitry admitted. “Was it Maalithren? Drolshan? Was that even the city’s name?”

“I don’t even know which direction we came from…”

Steven scratched his head and looked down all five roads.

“We can read the words now… but we still got no clue where we’re goin’.”

Dmitry grunted.

“Knowledge, but no experience.”

“Preach it, Kremlin Gandalf.”

They sighed. The silence returned.

Steven scratched his chin thoughtfully, eyes flitting between the five road signs as if any of them might blink first.

“Alright, Lex. Here’s what we do.”

Dmitry gave him a sideways glance, already dreading the pitch.

“You pick a road. I pick a road. We play rock-paper-scissors.”

Dmitry blinked. “Are you serious.”

“Dead serious,” Steven grinned. “If the Oc’Xari brought us here for a reason ; y’know, through all that star-map dream-ladder bullshit ; then maybe luck is the point.”

“Maybe they’re watchin’ right now, cheerin’ for the universe to throw a bone.”

Dmitry stared flatly.

“And your plan is to determine a multi-dimensional cosmic objective… with rock-paper-scissors.”

Steven nodded like a prophet delivering scripture.

“Exactly. You ever heard of divine dice-rolls? That’s what this is. Galactic chance. If we’re meant to go somewhere ; the road we choose by luck’ll be the one they wanted.”

Dmitry sighed.

“I spent thirty years building communication systems to interface with advanced alien cognition networks…”

“And now I’m gambling quantum coordinates with a Florida man over hand puppets.”

Steven raised his fists.

“Best of three?”

Dmitry groaned, shook his head “Just once” and held up his hand.

They shook.

“Rock, paper, scissors; shoot!”

Steven: scissors

Dmitry: rock

Steven’s smile faded.

“Damn.”

Dmitry looked at the sign he had picked ; Thesselvine.

“Guess that’s our road.”

Steven shrugged, stepping toward the path with hands behind his head.

“Welp. If it kills us, it’s technically your fault.”

Dmity snapped back- “*tsskk* It’s the Oc’Xari’s fault.”

“Thesselvine has a ring to it tho, I’m gonna call it ‘The Vine’ like it’s a vine back in the gator infested swamps of the Bayou,” Steven cheered.

Dmitry gave a small shake of his head, but his eyes had a flicker of amusement.

“So now we let chance guide our interstellar diplomacy?”

“Hell yeah,” Steven nodded. “Let fate steer. And if it goes bad, I’ll tell the next dream alien it was your fault.”

They set off down the path of the unknown ; a random roll of fate echoing through a dreamscape stitched by biology, memory, and mystery.

# Chapter 28 - Thesselvine

### I. A Whimsical World

The road wound gently, as if drawn by an artist’s hand across a tapestry. Sunrays danced through the massive green canopy overhead, dappling the path in soft gold.

They passed woven creatures lying across streams like bridges ; massive silken beings whose bodies formed pathways over slow-moving creeks. Here and there, a pond reflected violet skybeasts overhead. Thread-covered huts were nestled in mossy knolls, with no smoke rising from their chimneys, no doors ajar. No people, or elves, or aliens or whatever.

Just movement in the periphery ; a curtain drawn just before they looked, a furry door shuttering behind a silken leaf.

“Feels like deer season,” Steven whispered, eyes darting.

Dmitry paused as a large hairy woven creature slowly stretched out from behind a tree and covered a nearby home like a curtain ; hiding its occupants in a soft cocoon of fur and thread.

Eventually, the forest path curled toward a clearing where a sign stood. It was elegant ; large, woven into a natural archway of vines and threaded rootwork. Silk letters glittered across its surface, like embroidered starlight.

Dmitry stepped forward first, his hand tracing the glyphs slowly.

“Thess... el... vine...”


“Thesselvine.”

Steven let out a low whistle.

“It’s The Vine!”

“Yeah, the Vine” Dmitry muttered.

They crossed the sign into a settlement so seamlessly grown from the forest that it was almost hard to tell where nature stopped and civilization began. Small woven buildings clung to the trees like moss, and thread bridges connected everything in layers and spirals. The homes looked like bundled flower buds, waiting to bloom.

Still ; not a soul in sight.

Just more hushed movement behind petal-curtains and twitching vines.

Steven adjusted his belt.

“Well, either we stumbled into a giant hamster village, or this is what blanket-kitty-fort-heaven looks like when it’s shy.”

Dmitry stopped at another small sign near the town center ; this one more recent, written in careful, simple glyphs, like those in the children’s book.

He read it slowly.

“Memory fades slower… when spoken aloud.”

They stood in silence, reading it twice. Three times.

Then Dmitry looked around and whispered:

“We’re being watched.”

“Yeah,” Steven said. “Let’s give ‘em a show.”

And with that, they stepped into Thesselvine ; the village of thread and silence ; where fate had led them, and something deeper was waiting to be remembered.

---

They moved carefully now, the signs growing more frequent and deliberate.

Each signpost split into several directions, the winding paths of Thesselvine marked with silk-stitched glyphs and simple icons ; some showing symbols like fruit, others resembling musical shapes or spiraling plants.

But one icon stood out.

It was a building… or, at least, a symbol of one ; shaped like a cocoon unfolding, with a faint glowing thread spiraling out from its center.

“Looks like a dang bug church,” Steven muttered.

Dmitry tilted his head.

“No… more like a center. A core. An archive?”

Each sign bore the same glyph beside the icon, a word neither of them could fully translate… but they’d seen it enough to piece together a guess:

"Thēras’hil."

Whatever it meant, they followed it.

---

The further they walked, the less deserted the village became.

While the outer homes had been abandoned at their approach, this central district had movement ; cautious, yes, but not vanished.

Sylver elves moved between open-weave market booths, some carrying bushels of bioluminescent berries, others trailing threads from looms they wore on their backs. A pair of Weavers slithered past, carrying a cart made of vines and insect-like shells.

Many still watched Dmitry and Steven with uneasy glances, pausing mid-conversation or retreating behind walls ; but not fleeing.

Here, people still had things to do.

And they were doing them, even if under silent scrutiny.

“Looks like the downtown core,” Steven said.

Dmitry didn’t answer. He was scanning the buildings, all low and curved, half-grown into the forest itself ; yet all clearly functional, purposeful, and alive. Every home had some part of a living organism woven into it ; pulsing veins of color, shifting light panels, breathing walls.

And then; 

They found it.

The final sign, larger than the others, stood mounted on a curled arch of tree root and webbed thread. The icon was clear now ; unmistakable.

A sanctum.

Thēras’hil.

“Center of… something,” Dmitry whispered.


“Maybe ‘Artifact Museum.’ Or ‘Vault.’”

Ahead lay a strange facility ; it looked like a massive white cocoon woven in spider web. Its perimeter was defined by a fence-like structure, but no Earthly chain-link could match what they saw.

A living Weaver, enormous, its coat bristling with black coarse fibers like jagged glass or obsidian, had curled itself around the area, forming a wall. The hair quivered when the wind touched it ; but even the wind seemed reluctant.

And at the entrance, guarding the gate where the creature's silk had parted slightly like curtain folds, stood two Sylver soldiers.

These weren’t like the others.

Their armor was not thread, not silk, it almost looked like a weird type of processed hardened, enchanted amber resin.

Their weapons ; scissor-like polearms; were forged from that same resin material, with veins of fossilized fiber running through their handles.

They didn’t raise their weapons. But they didn’t step aside either.

The guards bowed.

Not in deference, but in formal recognition.

Dmitry bowed slightly in return. Steven half-bowed, mostly waved.

“Guess this is the right place,” Steven muttered.


“Either that, or we’re about to get shaved alive.”

Dmitry stepped toward the gate.

---

The guards didn’t move at first.

They stood motionless ; expressions unreadable, hands resting atop their strange shears, eyes gleaming faintly beneath softly glowing hoods of that hardened armor.

Dmitry hesitated.

Then stepped closer to the gate, squaring his shoulders.

He took a slow breath, reached back into the faded corners of his memory ; tracing stitched letters in the air with his mind ; and spoke.

“Thesselvine… Thēras’hil… uh…”


“Zra’kok shel’viv… uhnarh-ka’nuh… *zorak peb’l nu gruut…*”

The sentence was jagged. Misshapen. Probably criminal to their grammar.

It roughly translated to:

“We are here… I ask humbly… how your pet rock is doing?”

There was a long pause.

One of the guards tilted his head.

The other made a subtle gesture ; a curl of two fingers ; and the razor-haired weaver that made up the gate shivered, then retracted just enough to let them pass.

Steven leaned over to Dmitry .

“What did you say?”

“I think I said - We come to the city… in peace… to seek answers.” Dmitry muttered, stepping forward.

“Well… good job” Steven added, brushing past the vibrating hairs at the entryway, “you talked us into the dang mothball temple. Nicely done, Captain Rosetta Stone.”

---

One of the guards did follow.

Not aggressively ; just a quiet, steady patrol a few paces behind, the heavy shears across his back glinting under the filtered light. His presence wasn’t threatening, but it made one thing clear:

Don’t fuck around.

The moment Steven and Dmitry stepped through the glowing silk folds of the cocoon entrance, the atmosphere changed.

The interior was soft-lit, like daylight filtered through clouded milk-like glass. The air smelled of pressed linen, fermented honey, and blooming flora; oddly nostalgic, like a clean memory pulled from bliss times.

Inside, a small group of Sylver and woven beings moved about the space, each draped in regal, intricate robes spun with gold-thread patterns and organic iridescence. Despite the clear rank of these figures, none of them paid the humans any mind.

It was as if Steven and Dmitry were just another part of the décor ; expected guests, or perhaps simply nonthreatening anomalies.

The room stretched long like a gallery ; its walls woven, yes, but reinforced with crystalline panes that shimmered faintly when passed. Display cases lined the outer curve, subtle glyphs etched above each one in that same threaded language.

The human pair drifted towards the nearest case.

Inside: a delicately glowing sculpture, a helix of woven glass-fiber threads dancing in orbit around a black seed-like core. It didn’t seem to move… but would change depending on the angle you’d look at it.

Next: a weapon ; or maybe an instrument. A staff? A long, thin, twisted thing tipped with what looked like a woven tuning fork surrounded by a spiral of bone-lace.

Beside it: a gemstone, pulsing softly, the size of a heart. Its surface swirled with liquid starlight, but the plaque below depicted only two characters ; one of which Steven recognized from the macaroni message in his prison tray… 

“Tuk? Took? Tork? Tuhhh….? hmmm…” Dmitry scratched his head. 

“Look at this place…” Steven murmured, awe softening his voice.


“It’s like a museum and a cathedral had a baby and dressed it in a moonlight dress for a princess.”

Dmitry gave a slight nod, already mentally cataloguing each glyph, item, and impression.

The next case held something stranger ; a clear container filled with what looked like dried alien fruit, emitting some holographic images, as if it was photosynthesizing memories.

Beyond that, other display cases held:

- A woven glove that shimmered like quicksilver.
- A sweater, knitted with very expensive looking garments.
- A large, empty frame of woven branches and leaves that hummed quietly, like it was waiting for something to be placed inside.

All around them, the hall stretched like a dream archive ; a repository of untold treasures. The occasional doorway broke the otherwise continuous flow, marked only by signs in the silk alphabet.

Steven tapped Dmitry’s shoulder.

“Reckon one of these rooms might have somethin’... familiar?” Commented Steven.


“Maybe a book. Or another weird alphabet primer?” - Dmitry responded.

“Or hell, a cafeteria. I gotta eat something good before we wake up back to prison slop lunch… ugh, I don’t even think the goons of Nhexus would eat the lentils they served us the other day.” - Steven shivered. 

Dmitry didn’t answer. He was staring at one display case in particular ; frowning.

Inside, arranged neatly on a bed of green-gold silk…

Was a single guitar string.

Made of that same alien alloy as Dallas’ guitar back on Earth.

Threaded with strange knots and tiny etched glyphs that glowed faintly as Dmitry leaned closer.

The guard behind them shifted slightly, as if to warn them not to touch.

“Steven,” Dmitry said quietly, his voice like a tightening screw,


“We’re getting closer.”

---

At the far end of the gallery, Steven’s pace slowed. Something was different.

“Lex… Look at that.”


“That display’s on its own little pedestal.”

Dmitry glanced up from the glowing guitar string and followed Steven’s gaze.

Indeed ; at the very end of the chamber, there was a platform, just six inches higher than the rest of the floor ; but somehow, it carried twice the gravity. Extravagant steps led up to it. Around the base, rigid guard rails of hardened silk curled like bramble ; preventing anyone from stepping too close.

The display case at its center was larger, darker, and sealed in a glasslike box reinforced with tensioned thread ; some kind of organic lockframe.

But it was what sat behind the display that caught their breath:

An eye - it was apart of the wall.

Not carved. Not projected. But living. Watching.

The cocoon building they’ve been inside was a living weaver- and this was the eye of the beast, grown seamlessly into the architecture ; a gigantic black iris surrounded by slow-pulsing membranes of shimmer-silk, blinking once every twenty seconds or so. Like a surveillance camera, this display case was guarded by the building itself.

Steven shuddered.

“I don’t like that one bit…”


“Feels like it’s peekin’ into my soul… like it knows what I did in 11th grade behind the bleachers.”

Dmitry, already ascending the short steps, approached just close enough to see the object in the case:

An amulet.

The pendant shaped like a miniature pyramid, flawlessly symmetrical, each edge woven with gold-thread strands and delicate, embedded glyphs. At its apex, a small circular capstone blinked with faint pulses of orange and violet. A gold rope chain coiled underneath it, thick but elegant ; the kind of thing made to be worn, not stored.

Steven stared at it, hands on his hips.

“That’s… probably cursed as hell.”


“Looks like somethin’ a demon salesman would give you right before sellin’ your soul for a chicken wing.”

![u8296664269_haunting_cursed_demonic_artifact_pyramid_pendant__dfb8c5ce-c440-4d9e-a090-534f2328c1c4_2.png](Chapter%2028%20-%20Thesselvine/u8296664269_haunting_cursed_demonic_artifact_pyramid_pendant__dfb8c5ce-c440-4d9e-a090-534f2328c1c4_2.png)

Dmitry leaned forward slightly, eyes falling to the plaque beneath the glass.

It was stitched, not carved. Tiny, intricate threads ; no more than a few fibers thick ; embroidered clean letters across the base.

He began to sound them out.

Slowly.

Carefully.

His accent was thick, his pronunciation rough ; but on the third repetition, the phrase clicked.

He spoke it clearly ; like someone whispering the name of a sleeping god.

And in that moment, everything changed.

The chamber reacted.

The handful of Sylver nobles, who had until now politely ignored the humans, gasped and turned sharply. The royal Weaver ; coiled in a meditative braid near the side wall ; twitched upright, threads rustling like startled windchimes.

Even the guard behind them shifted in place, his eyes widening ever so slightly beneath his mask.

“I think you impressed them,” Steven said, voice low and wide-eyed.


“Or offended their babushka. Could go either way.”

Dmitry, still in disbelief at the reaction, slowly turned to the guard behind them.

He raised his hand and formed a question mark ; or at least, the alien equivalent he remembered from one of the signs.

Then, slowly, he pointed to the plaque and repeated the phrase again ; but this time with lifted palms and a clear tilt of uncertainty in his tone.

The message was understood.

The guards didn’t move.

But a group of royals did.

Three Sylver nobles ; two in elaborate woven gowns, and one cloaked in blue-threaded ceremonial silk ; approached quietly. The royal Weaver slithered behind them with deliberate grace.

They carried a folded writing mat, and what looked like a stylus, dipped in thick, fruit-like ink ; bright and sticky like jelly.

They laid it on a low table at the corner of the room beside some old papers, sitting on the soft, silken ground surrounding it.

A lesson began.

At first: a stick ; drawn, then labeled.

Then a star.

Then a rock, a hand, a sun, and a name ; each followed by the correct threadglyph.

Steven, thrilled, sat cross-legged like a kindergarten dropout.

Dmitry sat beside him, all seriousness ; absorbing everything, mapping logic, building translation rules in his head.

The Sylver found it... fun.

A game. Teaching 2 weird aliens (humans) the basics of their language.

---

### **II. Fairy Tales and Nursery Rhymes**

After nearly an hour of eager but broken communication, one of the Sylver royals waved toward the guard and murmured something melodic.

Though completely alien, their language carried phonemes Dmitry could nearly place. Enunciated vowels, common consonants. Sounded like soft, calming arcane-music.

The guard bowed and returned moments later, carrying a tray with crystalized goblets and a bottle of hardened glass-like resin. The Noble Weaver poured a glass for each Sylvar and for the humans. 

Steven blinked. "Fancy." He accepted his drink, and took a sip.

"Strawberries. Honey. Mint. But also... apricots?" he muttered. "And like... mood lifting? In flavor form?"

Dmitry agreed, “We could use at least a few dozen bottles of this back in the prison.” - with a grunt and a raise of his cup.

The Sylver royals continued their explanation of the artifacts in the room:

- The heart-sized gemstone had fallen from the sky during the Night of Cinders ; a meteorite whose heat-polished edges made it sacred.
- A strange tuning-fork-shaped artifact, said to be an enchanted sewing needle once used to stitch the royal funeral shrouds of a forgotten king.
- A woven glove preserved in honor of a beloved farmer, who toiled so hard in the silkwheat fields that his dedication earned him permanent remembrance.
- A sweater designed by one of the most iconic fashion designers in Thesselvine.

Then Dmitry, curious, pointed toward one particular item ; a faint guitar string, sealed beneath silk-glass.

"What... this?" he asked in broken Sylver- while he clearly recognized what it was.

One of the royals read the plaque.

"Two alien visitors appeared in the city of Drolshan. They vanished after one evening. On their guest bed ; this string was found."

Steven’s eyes went wide.

"That’s the place I picked! That’s the city from the sign! - Dmitry that’s when we first appeared, and when we phased out of this world back to the prison - we somehow left a guitar string?!"

Dmitry nodded. He muttered the human word "guitar," trying to teach them. The Sylver blinked, confused. They did not know what a guitar was.

So Dmitry took out a piece of fruit rind and drew one. Six lines, a rounded body, a fretted neck.

The Sylver stared, fascinated. One copied the shape.

Then Dmitry pointed at the pyramid amulet display case.

"And... this?"

A hush fell over the group.

The eldest royal, his threads wrapped in hues of midnight and bone-white, stepped forward. He drew slowly on the parchment.

He wrote a nursery rhyme ; one passed to Sylver children for generations:

---

"Beware the Pig who walks on three,
With fur of rot and eyes that see,
He'll grant you gold, he'll grant you fame,
But curse your kin and burn your name.

He speaks of luck, he sings of wealth,
He trades your soul for someone else's health.
So take the charm and wear it proud,
And watch your loved ones burn without sound."

---

When the rhyme was read aloud ; the royals chuckled.

"Children's tale. An old boogeyman myth, a legend." one of them said through half-learned Earth words.

But Dmitry and Steven... did not laugh.

They were dead silent, eyes fixed on the parchment.

Because on the corner of the page, drawn whimsically by a playful royal hand, was a small cartoon pig...

...with three legs.

And holes for eyes.

And horns that weren’t quite symmetrical.

Steven's voice was barely above a whisper:

"Lex... that’s the description of the thing Dallas and Haoyu said they saw in their dreams on Nhexus and Ferron."


Dmitry responded;
”The one… that told them to get out of its realm…”

One of the Sylver royals froze mid-step. Their long, glistening ears twitched, and they turned sharply ; pupils wide with an emotion that could only be described as ancestral fear.

“Did you say…” the royal asked in their melodic voice, though the pitch trembled slightly, “…the Pig?”

Dmitry nodded slowly, choosing his words with the caution of a man handling explosives.

“We haven’t seen it ourselves,” he said, voice rough. “But we know two people who have. Dallas… and Commander Zhang.”

The words hit the room like a silent earthquake.

The royals paled ; if their already pale, luminous skin could go any lighter. They whispered frantically among themselves in woven syllables, their soft music now a sharp, urgent melody. One waved to the guard. Another clutched their chest.

Within moments, they packed up their belongings and they were gone.

Every one of them ; the royals, the aides, even the hardened guard with his bone-shears ; had fled the chamber in hurried silence, like a ritual warning had been triggered.

Dmitry and Steven stood alone, in the heart of a sacred place, under the gaze of something they couldn’t yet name.

They looked at each other.

They turned slowly ; almost unwillingly ; and walked toward the platform at the far end of the hall.

The amulet still sat in its glass case. A pyramid shape, affixed to a thick golden chain. It glowed faintly, as if alive. As if watching them.

The security eye above it… was different.

It was a whole face now.

A face of rot, of disease, slack and sagging, its skin torn like old cloth, its snout dripping bile, with fangs and tusks of nightmares.

It was the face of a Pig ; or something that had once resembled one ; staring down from the wall with lifeless, cratered sockets of pure black void where eyes should be.

From it’s mouth, dripping pus filled saliva, pooling onto the glass of the display case sheltering the amulet.

A voice ; seeped into the room like black oil through silk:

“Would you like to make a deal?”

Dmitry’s breath caught.

Steven’s body locked.

The air felt thick, sticky, like wading through apathetic molasses. Every heartbeat was heavier. The presence of the Pig was not just visual. It was felt in the marrow.

Then the voice came again, harsher now, more directed:

“Why don’t you turn around… and look at what you’ve done to your Commander?”

Neither of them wanted to.

But their bodies moved ; unwillingly - as if the pig had a controller connected to them.

They turned.

And in the center of the glowing cocoon ; where once there had been only smooth woven floor ; now stood a prison.

A ribcage. Curved, yellowed, and fossilized. Its bones arched high above the floor like the bars of an organic jail cell.

Inside, curled into himself like a dying star, was Haoyu Zhang.

His body trembled. His head buried in his knees. His arms clutched tight around his legs. His skin ; pale, waxen. His back ; heaving with silent sobs. A man reduced to the embryo of grief.

“Haoyu…” Steven croaked, barely able to form the word.

It came out like rust off a broken hinge.

But the Pig was not finished.

Its voice, once a whisper, now exploded with wrathful thunder, rattling the very strands of the chamber’s walls:

“You opened the door in Nhexus.”

“You came to play a game in my realm.”

“And your Commander… has lost.”

Suddenly, the room dimmed. The cocoon glowed no longer. Threads on the walls receded, shrinking into darkness. The plaque under the amulet sizzled and turned black.

A shape began to emerge from the shadows at the far end of the hall.

It crawled.

A massive three-legged beast, oozing, pulsing, its flesh bubbled with blisters the size of pumpkins, some of them weeping pus. One leg was cracked down the middle, dragging broken bone. One arm clawed the ground; the other dragged a massive chunk of fused organic metal, part axe, part limb, part… who knows.

The stench hit them a second later.

A mixture of rotting meat, burnt hair, and wet dog.

It reached the ribcage.

It towered above Haoyu. And the Pig’s voice returned ; now laced with sadistic sarcasm.

“Haoyu… do I need to teach you proper manners?”

“Look at my guests.”

Haoyu moved.

Just barely.

His spine curled tighter first ; as if trying to fold further into himself. But something forced him up. A whisper? A command?

He looked up.

And Steven screamed - Dmitrys face went into utter shock 

Haoyu’s face was no longer human. His skin was pale and veiny, stretched unnaturally over cheekbones that jutted like blades. His mouth was stretched into a comically large smile. His eyes…

His eyes were black holes, just like the Pig’s.

His expression ; empty. As though all emotion had been cauterized.

Dmitry stumbled back and vomited on the floor, clutching his chest like the dream itself was suffocating him.

The Pig’s face split into a grotesque grin, torn skin peeling at the corners like burnt parchment.

“You have seen far too much for the mortal eye.”

A beat.

A pause.

And then the final command - with raging anger and impending doom

“**Now get out of my realm**.”

The sound of a harsh bell started blaring in the cocoon - as all went black…

---

Steven and Dmitry bolted upright in their prison beds, gasping, drenched in sweat. Chests heaving. Hands shaking.

The morning bell blared through the jail.

Breakfast trays would soon be slammed against bars.

But neither of them heard it.

Because in their minds, one image still burned:

Haoyu’s black eyes, staring through them.

And somewhere far away ; on another world, in another realm ; something was stirring.

# Chapter 29 - Despair

---

### **I. Two Years Since the Police Raid at Red’s Ranch**

**Day 821 of prison**

There were no more dreams.

No more signs. No symbols in the macaroni. No letters in the shower steam. No smudged alphabets in reflections.

Just the weight of memory.

And the haunted feeling of something watching… but never revealing itself.

---

Steven Young was the first to leave the facility.

The release papers said 821 days served. Early due to “demonstrated behavioral reformation” and a recommendation from the medical examiner citing “sub-clinical dissociation, likely prison-induced.”

They didn’t know it was the Pig that took his voice.

He didn’t smile when he stepped out of the gates.

Didn’t joke about gator hunting.

Didn’t spit a line of redneck wisdom.

He was quiet.

And that silence carried him all the way back to Tampa, Florida ; what was left of it.

The sky was grayer with smog. The streets were hotter. The oceans sat higher against cracked sea walls. The beaches littered with dog shit, garbage and homeless encampments.

Steven found a job delivering drone-dropped parcels for a mid-tier logistics company.

Owned, as irony would have it, by James Bethoz ; a name he couldn’t escape even now.

Steven’s resume said he once drove a rover on an alien planet. But nobody remembered - or cared, so now he wore a shirt that said “SwiftXpress”. He wear a VR headset he’d use to control drones for 12 hours a day delivering boxes of nutrient paste, disposable clothes, and AR goggles to wage-slaved tenants in vertical housing blocks that stretched so high they cut the sun in half.

---

Dmitry Alexeyev was processed a few weeks later and dumped back in Seattle.

He used to monitor interstellar transmissions.

He used to track anomalous quantum frequencies from satellites above the Nhexus system.

Now?

He mopped floors in a bio-plastic factory that smelled like boiling piss and fungal disinfectant.

Night shifts. Always night shifts.

He said it was because he couldn’t sleep.

But the truth was, he was afraid to.

The silence of the factory at 4:03 AM - that was when the fear came back.

---

The two men ; once legends in the Echofall Initiative ; now separately rented a slum module provisioned by the Emerald District Hive Program, a bottom-tier government-subsidized project of residential concrete stacks surrounded by graffiti, piled up garbage, junk drones, drug addicts, gangsters, crack whores and faulty neon signs.

They ate instant ramen.

Only had access to hot water twice a week.

Kept the lights off to save power credits.

The world moved on without them.

Alien dreams? Oc’Xari?

Slop worlds and thread cities?

No one remembered.

Nobody believed it.

And nobody cared.

Dmitry and Steven lived their own lives, apart in solitude for the next 8 years.

Confetti in Los Angeles. Fireworks over Tampa. Candle-lit tables in Albany.

The world celebrated, oblivious to the cosmic horror buried in silence.

**Yuyan Chan** sipped champagne at a cousin’s house in San Francisco.

He smiled politely at jokes and stories he didn’t care about.

A warm room filled with light and laughter.

But when the countdown reached zero, his eyes flicked to the corner of the ceiling.

He swore, just for a second, he saw a thread... as if it was trying to get his attention - but was nothing.

**Pragnya Reddy** clinked a plastic cup at her niece’s party in Dallas Texas.

Her parents proud of her career accomplishments.

She forced a smile, but the grief over losing the project and team never left her.

---

**Haoyu’s son**, the one who’d fall asleep with the stuffed dino 10 years ago - is twenty now, sat at his narrow desk in a shoebox apartment four stories underground in Los Angeles Sector 77.

The screens around him blinked, analyzing anomaly reports for a defense AI firm.

It paid well enough to get by… but, not enough to afford an above ground condo unit with windows.

But on the corner of the desk; between an anime figurine and a cracked mug; 

was a photo.

His father.

Taken twelve years ago, before the trial, before the fall.

The son would never admit he cried last week. But he did.

---

Haoyu’s daughter, sixteen, wore glittery heels and a skimpy dress. Living with her 21 year old rich, famous, athlete boyfriend in St. Louis, Missouri

The basketball star mistreated her and joked to his entourage that she was “like some post-apocalypse fairy tale girl.”

She didn’t laugh.

They didn’t know she still had night terrors, or cared much about her past trauma.

Every time she hears loud bangs or thuds - the feint echo of the police raid flash banging the house - and the memories of the past pour in - so she puts up trauma walls, intentionally avoiding loud activities.

---

Their mother, alone in Albany, New York, wore the same cardigan she’d worn for the past three winters.

She stirred gray porridge on an old stove, the only light coming from three tiny picture frames hanging crooked above her table.

One for Haoyu.

One for her son.

One for her daughter.

She hadn’t spoken to either of them in over a year.

She whispered “Happy New Year” to the photos, and sobbed in tears for the rest of the night.

---

Dmitry, still in Seattle, mopped up spilled bio-ink from the factory floor.

The supervisor didn’t even nod at him as he passed.

At midnight, the pipes above groaned.

Steam hissed.

Dmitry looked up from his mop, exhaled a long breath, and whispered something in Sylver tongue; a phrase he barely remembered.

Then went back to mopping.

Steven Young sat on the beach in Tampa, surrounded by laughter and music.

He held a bottle of cheap beer. Unopened.

Bonfires lit the sand. Fireworks boomed over the ocean.

He didn’t blink when one exploded too low and startled a kid nearby.

He just kept staring forward; dead-eyed, numb.

A girl flirted with him. He didn’t hear her.

He only heard the bangs of the fireworks, remembering:

“POLICE! OPEN UP!”

---

**Calgary Maximum Prison**

Dallas Red sat motionless behind the same rusted bars.

He kept a drawing taped to his wall; a crayon sketch from one of the refugee children he saved way back during the pre-invasion chaos.

The kids drawing showed his ranch, the cows, and a stick-cowboy resembling Dallas under a smiling sun.

It was faded. Torn.

He stared at it for hours each night.

Sometimes, he smiled. But only a little.

The refugee families he’d once housed came and went.

They protested.

They shouted.

They marched.

But the world never heard them.

Their signs were banned.

Their videos scrubbed.

Their voices... censored by media… nobody outside from a few towns in Canada knew Dallas ever existed.

His name would fade into time of the coming decades.

# Chapter 31 - The Bayou Prison

**Angola Supermax Facility in Louisiana**

And finally; 

Haoyu Zhang.

Once a commander.

Once a father, a scientist, a hero.

Now?

Just a ghost.

A skeleton folded into a metal shoebox no wider than a coffin.

Ten years in a windowless cell, a solid windowless door with just a slot, with the fluorescent light on above him the entire time.

He would fight sleep, but he would pass out from sleep deprivation every 4-7 days depending how long he resisted - when he did sleep, the Pig came and tormented him relentlessly.

When he was awake for more than a couple days - sleep hallucinations would kick in - he would think the pig was out in the hallway of his cell, talking to him, banging on the cell door.

Haoyu’s cell didn’t have a toilet, rather; he pissed into a hole in the center of his room.

Shit into the same one - and as he was doing his business, the Pig would often startle him - making him think the pig would reach its hand out of the hole, tickling his ankles and butt cheeks and reaching up his ass, completely humiliating him.

Haoyu didn’t eat, so the guards gave him nutrient injections twice a week, mostly just to keep his brain alive for the pending execution.

The guards had to restrict him each time, because Haoyu would go insane, thinking the guards were pigs tormenting him.

He thought he could hear it breathing behind the walls.

Sometimes, he screamed for hours - he would scream at the pig to get out of his head… in such moments, the other prisoners and prison guards collectively believed he was mentally insane.

Sometimes, he tried to chew his own wrists, the guards would have to come and cuff his hands behind his back to make him stop.

The Pig was always watching.

![33.jpg](Chapter%2031%20-%20The%20Bayou%20Prison/33.jpg)

---

In seven days, he would be transferred to a supermax in Mississippi, where they’d begin the execution protocols.

Prep his body.

Broadcast the sentence.

Erase the last traces of the Echofall project from Earth.

Just another victim, painted as a criminal with the colors of propaganda and conspiracy.

Just another lie buried under history.

---

Seven days.

Seven long, uneventful days had passed.

Nothing had changed for the world.

But everything was about to change for Haoyu Zhang.

The morning of the seventh day, the prison warden stood in the control tower of Louisiana Supermax, reviewing the plan with a heavy heart and a dry mouth. His reputation was clinical, emotionless ; but even he knew:

“The once exalted Commander Zhang is gone. What’s left down there ain’t a man anymore.”

One of the ex-military prison guards spoke up 

“Do you think Zhang would have turned out a little better if he got a normal sized jail cell?”

The room was quiet for a moment… although they never met or worked with Commander Zhang, he *was*-or used to be recognized and respected in the military and science community… none of these guards felt good about the situation… they knew that wasn’t the real Haoyu Zhang who once dominated space.

The warden breathed out heavily.

“Our job is to obey authority, the decision was not ours to make.”

“NOW” - he promptly followed up, back in action.

He tapped the whiteboard with a composer stick displaying a drawn schematic.

“We don’t open that cell unless we’re wearing armor and weaponized to the teeth.”

The plan was precise:

- One straight jacket ; custom-fitted, reinforced for psychotics, pressure-lock stitched.
- One human bite muzzle ; designed for high-risk mental wards.
- One guard manning the net gun, modified with durable sticky mesh.
- Two guards wielding 8-foot electric restraint rods, meant to pin and disable Haoyu from a distance.
- And finally, six more guards, stacked and ready to dogpile, hold, bind, and carry.

**Cell 09A.**

The light had been on for ten years straight, in Zhao’s shoe closet.

His body reeked of sweat, vomit, shit and piss.

His mind ; hollowed.

He sat there. Hunched. Jaw twitching. Lips muttering inaudible things to someone who wasn’t there.

“They’re coming, the pigs are coming… I can hear them. They’re gonna open the door. Don’t let them… don’t let-”

**CLANK.**

The first lock disengaged.

**CHUNK.**

Second bolt.

He started hissing.

Mouth wide. Neck stretched. A half-man, half-feral rat thing, coiled in a corner.

The door swung open.

He launched at them ; a gnarled flash of growling filth and hatred.

The net fired. ZAP. The rods struck.

He shrieked like a boiling demon cooking in a cauldron of holy water.

The dogpile hit him like a collapsing wall. Elbows, knees, boots, rubber grips and groaning metal.

They strapped the jacket on.

He fought.

They forced on the bite muzzle ; black leather, reinforced steel. Clicked it tight as he snapped like a starved dog.

Haoyu’s breathing was wild, nostrils flared, his pupils spiraling.

“LET ME GO. IT’S STILL IN HERE. THE PIG IS COMING FOR ALL OF US! THE PIG WILL DESTROY THE GALAXY! YOU WILL SEE! YOU WILL ALL SUFFER IN THE UNIVERSE FOREVER!”

But no one answered.

They hauled him upstairs.

---

And then… the outside.

For the first time in a decade, he saw sunlight.

It struck his skin like acid.

He screamed, turned his head, kicked wildly.

He melted under the brightness ; like a vampire fed to dawn.

Flashbacks detonated across his brain like landmines:

**FLASHBANGS.**

POLICE! OPEN UP!

Remembering something about police breaking into a house he had been in a long time ago as if it was some broken memory of a past life he lived…

Crying children in his memories which he didn’t recognize (his children)

Some strange woman screaming (his wife)

Some wild buckin’ Cowboy that confused him even more… why is the cowboy so familiar?

Then ; something broke.

A crack. An epiphany! A break through the Amnesia.

Not in his body. In his mind.

“Wait…”

He blinked.

“My son…” he whispered through the muzzle.

“My daughter… my wife… Dallas… Pragnya… Dmitry… Yuyan…”

“Steven…”

For the first time in years, Haoyu remembered he had a family.

He remembered his crew, his home, his mission.

The guitar.

The saloon.

The sky.

It hit him like a flood.

He hadn’t thought about them in years.

The Pig had erased them through merciless torment.

He forgot he was even a human, he forgot what planet he lived on, he forgot he was even alive, he never seen a single human in a decade asides from prison guards whom he thought were pigs anyways ; all he knew was unyielding torture.

He didn’t know he had ever been loved.

He started to remember the night at the ranch when his kids were happy, laughing, playing, and his wife was cuddling him, smiling and living in peaceful, loving joy.

Tears leaked beneath the bite mask.

He was shoved, bound and limp, into the back of an armored transfer truck.

But it had windows.

Windows.

He stared through them in disbelief.

“The sky… The… The grass…” he mumbled.

The blue was pale. The clouds were faded. But it was still the sky.

The grass was littered with trash and highway dust, but it was beautiful. 

The engines hummed.

The truck rolled forward. 

Destination:

**Mississippi Supermax.**

A final cell.

A final breath.

An execution at last ; for a man who’d already died a long time ago, just hadn’t been buried yet.

And far behind him, Cell 09A… the place he called home for 10 years.

# Chapter 32 - Mississippi Supermax

**Intake Ward. Sublevel 3.**

They hauled him inside like dead cargo.

His body was limp, but twitching. His eyes ; too wide, too dark. The muzzle pressed red lines into his cheeks. The straightjacket creaked every time he breathed, barely.

He was plopped down hard onto a medical cot, the kind that hummed as it scanned.

**Vitals**:

**Heart rate**: fast and irregular.

**Blood pressure**: erratic.

**Muscle mass**: atrophied beyond predictive models.

**Cognitive function**: “*unreadable*.”

Then came the psych eval.

Room 4B. Padded, sterile, humming with fluorescence.

Still in his bindings, still muzzled, Haoyu was wheeled into place like a tiger in a cage ;not a man.

Across from him sat Dr. Jennifer Lynn, forensic psychologist, 35 years in the system.

She had profiled serial killers. Torture lords. War criminals.

She clicked on her recorder.

“Subject: Haoyu Zhang. Age, 64. Prisoner ID: Omega-Xi-Seven. Initial psychological triage.”

She leaned forward. Calm. Steady.

“Commander Zhang. Do you know where you are?”

Haoyu’s head lolled sideways. His lips twitched.

“Pig…”

“The pig is here.”

Dr. Lynn frowned, but continued.

“You’ve been in solitary for ten years. Can you tell me who the pig is?”

His eyes opened wider. Pupils dilated like a corpse.

“He lives in the pipes.”

“He tickles my butthole.”

“He taunts me while I shit.”

A pause.

Then he started laughing; soft at first, then high-pitched, strained, giddy.

It didn’t last long.

He snapped back to silence so fast, the air seemed to freeze around him.

Lynn scribbled something.

“You were a scientist, Commander. A decorated officer. A family man. Do you remember your family?”

Haoyu didn’t answer.

Then, with sudden clarity, he whispered:

“I forgot them.”

A long breath.

“He made me forget…”

“My daughter… my son…”

“They were… names in a dream I don’t… I don’t know if I made them up… The pig was telling me every day; it was just my imagination... I can’t… quite put a finger on it… was my wife… real? my kids…”

Haoyu Zhang zoned out blankly in deep thought.

Lynn stared, frozen.

In 35 years, she had assessed nearly five hundred broken minds.

“He’s in a severe state of amnesia,” she murmured into her recorder.

She leaned closer, despite every instinct telling her not to.

“Haoyu, is the Pig in the room with us? Right now?”

He shook his head. Slowly. Without blinking.

“Not… right here, but he’s close. He’s very close.”

“He’s sleeping in the vents, I can hear him snoring... we have to be quiet” he whispered

“Sometimes, when I’m pissing, he climbs out of the hole… and tortures my cock and balls.”

Lynn had to look away. Her hands were shaking.

Haoyu kept speaking.

“You think I’m here ‘cause I ran from court?”

“Because I took my family on a vacation to hell?”

He coughed ; a sick, raspy laugh.

“You’re wrong.”

“I opened the door.”

“It was me. The Echofall probe… it wasn’t just science. It was an invitation.”

He slumped.

“We opened a gate… I don’t know to where, but he came through…”

“And now… he’s using us like toys.”

Silence

“Haoyu Zhang is no longer fit for public or private containment.”

“His execution should be scheduled promptly.”

Two guards stepped into the room ; silent, armored, emotionless, they came to take him away…

But before they could touch him, Dr. Lynn raised a hand.

“One more moment.”

The guards paused.

She glanced at her assistant ; a nurse with trembling hands ; and then looked back at Haoyu.

“Commander Zhang…” she asked softly. “Do you remember the planet Nhexus?”

His eyes twitched. Lips parted. Something stirred behind the madness.

“Do you remember the invasion alerts you raised… the ones the world dismissed?”

“The leaked footage… the pyramid structures on the dead world?”

At first, just silence.

But then;

A tremble.

And then ; clarity.

His posture shifted, ever so slightly. The shaking slowed. His voice grew steady, grave. For a moment, it was as if - Zhang was completely normal…

“The Echofall probe landed in the Expanse Quadrant, Region Theta-19. The terrain was scorched. Dust was red. The sky was thin… fractured. Dead but not still.”

“The rover transmitted seventeen full panoramic sweeps. But Frame 213-B… showed something else.”

He looked up, directly at the doctor.

“Entities.”

“Shadow-formed. Bipedal. When we conducted multiple scans and tests with the EON7-b rover, it was clearly confirmed in the data… these entities were not from Nhexus, instead they were ethereal beings from another planet called Oc’Xari.”

“They were there for months, standing near the base of the central pyramid. Watching the rover, until later during Easter was when we captured the first real image of it, with scans and tests 100% confirming what we saw was not a hallucination.”

Lynn blinked.

He went on.

“Then, I… I started having these strange dreams. There was this saloon, called the Chuckwagon Cafe… in Diamond Valley, Alberta… I… I’ve never even been to Canada before, I never heard of it. But that’s where I met Dallas, and that’s where the … the…”

Lynn leaning forward “The what? What was there in the Saloon?”

His voice cracked. As his clarity started to fade, back into fear and hysteria

“He… he woke up… he’s in the vents, he’s crawling, he’s coming, oh noooo, he heard me, and he’s coming, noo, no, please, please save me.”

He cried and wimpered to Jennifer Lynn like child trying to hide from a bully, but unable to move, still restrained.

His gaze shifted. Past Lynn. Behind her.

His breathing grew shallow. Eyes wide open.

And he started to profusely panic.

Not just tears ; but desperate, choking sobs, his body curling in on itself like a beaten dog.

“Please…” he whispered. “No. Not again. Please…”

Dr. Lynn felt some sort of presence behind her… over her left shoulder, where Haoyu was fixated at… the hair on her arms stood up, she slowly turned her head.

Just a glance.

Just enough to look behind her.

Nothing there.

Just a padded wall.

She sighed. A flicker of frustration crossing her brow ; the embarrassment of being tricked by a crazed lunatic.

Haoyu started yelping, his body jutting every 2-4 seconds, screaming he’s sorry, as if someone was beating him.

She gave a silent signal to the guards.

And as they dragged him from the room ; Haoyu screaming, weeping, begging for someone, anyone, to make it stop ; the doctor pressed a final note into her recorder:

“Subject exhibits signs of advanced trauma psychosis.”

“Critical PTSD inflicted by extended isolation, guilt, and prolonged exposure to leaked reconnaissance from the planet Nhexus.”

“Symptoms include extreme hysteria, memory degradation, persistent hallucinations of anthropomorphic entities, and delusional thought loops.”

“Recommendation: sentence continuation. Execution order confirmed.”

She signed the report. Time-stamped. Biometrically sealed.

Whispered to herself in pity “Put him out of his misery, let him rest.”

The system processed it within the hour.

By midnight, the execution was approved.

The date was set: three days from now.

No appeals.

No hearings.

No hope.

Just three more days…

Three more nights…

Of nonstop torture inside the Mississippi Supermax.

Because the Pig ; the thing that had followed Haoyu through the stars, through his dreams, through the fold of his own mind ; lived in that cell now.

It breathed in the corners.

It scratched at the walls.

It whispered behind the drain.

It laughed when the lights flickered.

And as the countdown began, Haoyu Zhang ; once a commander, once a father, once a hero ; was reduced to nothing but a crazed mongrel.

# Chapter 33 - Decay

### **I. Another Round at the Chuckwagon**

As an experienced Forensic Psychologist, Dr. Jennifer Lynn knew a mental condition like this was borderline impossible, especially for a man who was a dignified Commander from the age of 30.

Lynn sat in her car, engine ticking in the silence of the underground parking garage, unable to shake the memory of Haoyu Zhang’s eyes; the way his voice shifted, the clarity that surfaced before it was dragged back into madness.

That pig he kept rambling about…

**The Chuckwagon Café.**

Lynn opened her laptop at home, steam rising from a bowl of instant noodles she barely touched. A quick search led her to it: a real place. Tucked away in a quiet little town called Diamond Valley, Alberta. Population barely 5,000. A tiny roadside stop in the middle of vast Canadian prairie-lands.

It was real.

And something about that fact; about *him* naming something that actually existed; made her feel colder than anything he’d said in that padded room.

Lynn filed a travel request the next morning under investigative grounds.

Her team didn’t ask many questions.

Within seventy-two hours, she was behind the wheel of a rented sedan, watching wheat fields roll by under an open blue sky. It was winter. The prairies dry, not much snow, the clouds drifted like lazy cattle.

She arrived just past noon.

The gravel crunched beneath her tires as she pulled into the Chuckwagon Café’s lot; just three cars in the whole place. She sat still for a moment, before she turned the key, stepped out, and closed the door with a quiet *thunk*.

The cold wind met her immediately; it was hard to adjust to, coming from Mississippi.

The café looked exactly like what the name promised. A squat, homey diner with faded red trim, a wooden porch, and a large sign overhead in big, looping letters: *Chuckwagon Café*. A horseshoe was bolted above the door.

Jennifer Lynn climbed the steps slowly, eyes sweeping across the details; the old license plates nailed to the siding, the frozen flowerpots, the sticker-covered window.

She stepped inside.

A soft jingle of a bell above the door announced her arrival.

Inside was quiet, except for the faint hum of a country ballad playing from a jukebox in the corner and the clink of a spoon in a ceramic mug.

From behind the counter emerged a cheerful woman in her mid-thirties, blonde hair tied back in a loose ponytail, apron dusted with flour.

“Hi there, welcome in! Just one today?”

Jennifer nodded.

“Yes. Just one.”

“Grab any seat you like, sweetie. I’ll be right over with a menu and some coffee.”

Jennifer slid into a booth by the window, taking in the room. Old photographs hung on the walls, prairie sunsets, horses, a few black-and-white rodeo shots from decades past.

Moments later, the hostess returned with a mug of coffee and a practiced smile.

“Here you go; house blend. Strong enough to wake a mule.”

Jennifer smiled faintly.

As the hostess turned to walk away, Jennifer cleared her throat and reached into her jacket, flipping open her badge with quiet precision.

“Excuse me… I’m a federal agent. Just doing a bit of follow-up on a closed file.”

She slid a worn photograph across the table; an old ID shot of Haoyu Zhang.

“Have you ever seen this man?”

The waitress blinked, tilting her head. At first, confusion. Then a squint.

She leaned forward slightly, examining the picture.

“Hmm… I’m not sure. Looks sorta familiar but…”

She trailed off, eyes drifting upward in thought.

Then it hit her.

“Wait-actually, yeah. Yeah, I think I did see him. Years ago now. Maybe even a decade? He came in alone, seemed real tense. Sat right there-” she pointed to a corner table. “Kept checking his watch, like every minute.”

Jennifer stayed silent, taking it in.

“Then like 10 minutes before the cafe closed, this cowboy guy shows up-real weathered lookin’, denim shirt, maybe in his sixties. They barely ordered anything. Slammed their coffee, left a fat tip, and took off like the place was on fire.”

“Why? Was he in trouble?”

Jennifer looked down at the photo again. Her voice soft.

“Confidential.”

The waitress nodded, then smiled.

Jennifer Lynn ordered the all-day breakfast. Eggs, toast, some kind of local sausage that smelled faintly of sage. It was yummy… comforting, in that heavy prairie kind of way. As she ate, she scanned the café slowly. Not just glancing, but *really* looking.

There was nothing out of the ordinary.

Just a regular little roadside diner.

No signs of madness. No ancient carvings. No weird vibes.

Just coffee, cowboy photos, and a squeaky ceiling fan spinning lazy circles overhead.

Halfway through her plate, she excused herself to use the bathroom.

The hallway was short, narrow, and smelled faintly of pine cleaner. She stepped into the single-occupant restroom and closed the door behind her, twisting the old bronze latch until it *clicked*.

She relieved herself, flushed, and stepped up to the sink.

White porcelain. Warm water. Faint hum of old plumbing.

She turned the tap off… and looked up to meet her reflection.

Only… there was no mirror.

Instead, mounted directly above the sink, was a **gilded gold picture frame**, thick and ornate, encrusted with tiny patterns of swirls and laurel leaves like something pulled from the Versailles palace.

But inside the frame was no landscape. No western painting.

It was a **portrait**.

A man; no, a *figure;* seated in an impossibly elegant throne. Black tuxedo. Crisp bowtie. white gloved hands resting on armrests carved from precious metals.

But the **head** was all wrong.

Not human.

**A pig.**

A pig’s head. Furry, with fangs, massive horns. Its eyes; those *eyes*; not part of the painting’s texture. They looked real, reflective, wet, alive. Like holes cut out of the canvas with a real beast behind it. 

And they were looking at her.

Not past her.

**At her.**

Jennifer froze.

Her breath caught in her throat, hands dripping over the sink.

It felt like something had entered the room; like the temperature had dropped five degrees.

The air tightened, pulled into a vacuum.

She blinked once. Twice.

Still there.

The pig’s gaze didn’t waver. Its posture remained perfect. That tuxedo; it looked expensive. Tailored. Ancient and timeless all at once.

Her pulse quickened.

She backed out slowly; one step, then two; never turning her back, not until she was fully in the hallway again. Only then did she exhale, chest trembling.

She returned to the front, walked up to the counter.

“Hey,” she said carefully to the waitress. “What’s with the painting in the bathroom?”

The woman looked up from wiping a mug.

“Painting?” she said, puzzled.

“Yeah,” Jennifer nodded. “Of the pig. In a tuxedo. On a throne.”

The waitress squinted, genuinely confused.

“I’m… not sure? That’s strange.”

She frowned, wiping her hands on her apron.

“Hang on.”

She walked down the hallway, pushed open the restroom door, and peeked inside.

“Huh…”

Her voice trailed off.

“That is weird. I used the bathroom this morning. There was a mirror there. Like, for sure.”

She stepped inside to check more closely.

“Looks expensive… Maybe the owner came in and swapped it out? But I never saw any other staff come and go today. I don’t know.”

She shrugged, genuinely baffled.

Jennifer watched her, quiet. The air felt off again. And somehow the hallway looked weird now… it wasn’t different, but it held something *just slightly* out of phase with reality.

“Probably just a prank,” the waitress offered with a shaky laugh. “Small towns, right?”

“Right…” Jennifer murmured.

She returned to her booth. Finished her breakfast with a little less appetite… staring at the hallway as it just seemed like it wasn’t real anymore.

Paid in cash.

Left quietly.

![DALL·E 2025-05-11 22.04.00 - A Rococo-style oil painting hanging on a wall, with the entire ornate gilded gold picture frame fully visible. The frame is thick, highly detailed wit.webp](Chapter%2033%20-%20Decay/DALLE_2025-05-11_22.04.00_-_A_Rococo-style_oil_painting_hanging_on_a_wall_with_the_entire_ornate_gilded_gold_picture_frame_fully_visible._The_frame_is_thick_highly_detailed_wit.webp)

As she stepped outside, the cold winds had picked up. The prairie breeze now carried a scent she couldn’t place; like iron and oil.

She looked back at the café once more.

And wondered what else Haoyu had been right about.

She opened the driver’s side door, slid in, and pulled it shut with a soft **thunk**.

Keys in the ignition.

Click.

She turned it over.

The engine started with a low grumble; and the radio came on with it.

Mid-sentence. Deep. Gravelly. An evil voice spoke deep within her soul.

“I know you’re looking for me… if I were you, I’d stop.”

Jennifer froze.

Her hand on the key.

The voice was slow. Measured. Ancient in tone, but not dated.

It filled the cabin, louder than it should have been. Unmistakable.

Then; like a tape skipping; another voice cut in.

“And that, folks, was the villain’s big moment from the 2047 psychological thriller The Hollow Quiet. Great flick. We’ll be back after this quick break-”

Light guitar music played.

Jennifer sat there, unmoving.

A chill crept up her arms. She reached for the dial and turned the volume down; but not off. Her fingers hovered for a moment.

She replayed the sentence in her head.

It *was* a movie quote. She even remembered it now that the host had said the title.

But something was wrong.

The timing. The *way* it had hit.

Like the voice hadn’t come from the radio at all, but from something deeper; *through* the speakers.

*To* her.

She looked out the windshield at the Chuckwagon Café.

Still just a diner.

Still just a dusty gravel lot.

But the longer she sat there, the more that single sentence rang in her skull.

“I know you’re looking for me… if I were you, I’d stop.”

She put the car in gear.

And didn’t say a word the entire drive back.

She returned to Mississippi the next morning, silent through the airport, quiet on the shuttle, numb in the elevator as the doors closed around her and sealed her back into the sterile hum of her daily world.

A crisp form sat neatly on her desk, stamped and signed.

**Authorization: Special Site Reconnaissance – Case File Omega-Xi-Seven**

Approved.

She stared at it.

Everything in her report had been green-lit: her travel, her expenses, the rationale to investigate the Chuckwagon Café.

Her findings section was blank, waiting.

And she filled it in with shaking fingers:

"Site visited.


Observed subject location.

No anomalous activity.

No further action required."

No mention of the painting.

No mention of the mirror that wasn’t there.

No mention of the radio.

She clicked submit.

It was easier that way.

Better to be sane than right.

And just like that; it was over.

Filed. Forgotten.

The Chuckwagon Café was marked as *ordinary,* and Haoyu Zhang marked as *insane.*

And it was never spoken of again.

# Chapter 34 - A Choice To Make

---

### **I. The Final Night - 2548**

It had been almost a decade since the raid on the ranch.

Dmitry worked alone in the graveyard shift of a rotting, hollowed-out factory in Seattle; mopping the same grease-stained tiles, pushing the same rickety cart. The city outside had long decayed into a smog-choked slum hive, and his life had reduced to a cold meal, a cold bed, and colder silence.

That night, his path took him into the basement. He needed a new mop head.

The concrete stairwell echoed beneath his boots as he descended. The lights down there flickered; always had; and the far corner of the basement, beyond the reach of any lightbulb, remained pitch black. A permanent void.

As he reached for the supply shelf-

A voice.

Shaky. Familiar.

“Dmitry…”

He froze. Slowly turned. His pulse thumped in his neck.

Another whisper. This time clearer.

“Dmitry…”

Steven’s voice.

No doubt about it.

Dmitry scanned the room, did a full spin. Then stared at the corner of pure darkness.

“Steven?” he muttered.

![cellar.jpg](Chapter%2034%20-%20A%20Choice%20To%20Make/cellar.jpg)

From the void… 

“Don’t be shy, Steven. Ask your friend for mercy.”

A figure stepped forward just enough to be outlined by the weak ambient glow. Steven. Shaking. Tears glimmered in his eyes.

One foot shuffled forward. A flip-flop.

Dmitry spotted something curling around Stevens foot; a tendril, slow and sludgy… the pig, was behind him. He didn’t see it, but he *knew*

“Do you want to make a deal, Dmitry?” Steven sobbed. “Please…”

Dmitry backed up half a step.

“A deal? I have nothing left. I’m just a janitor. A broken man in a broken world.”

The voice snarled.

“Ungrateful worm.”

“Turn around, look at what you’ve done to your commander.”

Dmitry paused, turned-

Behind him, impossibly-

A jail cell. Materialized out of basement brick and void.

Inside: Haoyu.

Sitting in the corner, knees to his chest. Sobbing. Rocking back and forth like a child in terror.

“His execution is tomorrow,” the demon said. “When he dies… I will consume what’s left of his soul. And I will torture it beyond death, beyond time; long after the stars fade and the universe cools to silence.”

Dmitry, teeth gritted, growled:

“That makes no sense. Nothing lasts longer than the universe.”

The pig laughed.

The voice shifted, almost amused.

"Oh, Dmitry. Always so clever."

“Let me teach you something, Dmitry.”

“When the universe was young, long before your kind crawled out of sludge, there were **The Ancient Ones;** architects of the LUCA seed ; who feared the death of their genetics more than to tamper with the natural lifecycle of the universe. So they built their LUCA Canon, fired their desperate hope across the stars. Trillions of cells. Trillions of sparks of fabricated hope, in places hope shouldn’t be.”

“They played God. wanted to save life. Not for you. For themselves. What a narcissistic goal”

“Of the thousands of planets seeded, only a handful survived. Did you know, there is another ancient civilization that predates LUCA? The ***Avaris from Kavariin*** - You see, I have never visited Kavariin. Because they are still a part of the original, natural life of the universe - they didn’t play God, and they are not synthetically created evolved beings such as yourself. So I don’t need to meddle in their affairs. They play by my rules.”

“But the rest? There were many worlds like Nhexus, not identical, but similar... they suffered for billions of years. Places like Nhexus would have never existed in my classic rules of life in the universe - no, no, nothing like that would have ever happened! Your planet got very lucky Dmitry, dumb luck that you exist the way you do, and not as a puddle of agonized suffering slop.”

“This is my realm, Dmitry. My game, my house, my rules.”

“I was there before the universe existed, I was there when life budded and became, I designed the perfect solar system habitats for life to thrive in harmony and joy, it was such a beautiful phenomena. The beings who constructed the LUCA Canon tempered with the glorious cycle of life in my realm, they RUINED life..”

Dmitry’s throat tightened. “So a lot life in our galaxy asides from Kavariin... came from a cannon? We’re all just cousins of ancient arrogance?”

The Pig laughed.

“Such petty questions. And yet, yes.”

“If they had not intervened-
No Nhexus. No pain. No Commander. No torment.
No reason for me to come.”

“Now I am here. With you.”

There was a strange shift in perspective that Dmitry now had toward the Pig. It wasn’t a pig.

It was… maybe… the Creator of the universe?

The universe was its project ; something it had carefully designed, with pre-selected planets, each one chosen as a perfect place for life to begin, evolve, and flourish over billions of years in the gentle, structured ways it had intended. It had a plan for lifecycles, it had a roadmap plan - engineering how the universe would unfold.

But when the LUCA seed was launched… It was like a bug, a virus in the system, ruining an immaculately designed universe.

**The Ancient Ones** unraveled the thread of prophecy.

They had recklessly littered the stars with low-quality, synthetic life ; trash biology on random unlivable worlds that evolved into nothing but pain, suffering, and horrific amalgamations of “life” that should have never existed in the Architect’s ideal universe. The Oc’Xari being the biggest issue - essentially they are an immortal life essence that would live forever. A stain on a white designer dress.

This is why the entity was so enraged.

To us, it appeared evil.

But to it, this was justice.

Something far beyond mortal comprehension.

But Dmitry uttered an understanding statement;

“So, you are the custodian of the stars you-or maybe something else created, trying to clean up the mess of an ancient, ignorant alien civilization that ruined what you had planned.”

The voice purred.

“Very impressive, Dmitry Alexeyev. Signal architect. Driver of the Nhexus rover. It was a curious machine you designed.”

The silence returned.

Only Haoyu’s whimpering remained. His sobs were small. Shattered.

And then…

“So…” the demon said, voice smooth like oil and rot.

“About that deal.”

### **II. Options**

Again, Dmitry spoke, voice low and bitter.

“I can’t make a deal. I don’t have anything. I have no power in this world.”

The voice answered ; calm, heavy, ancient:

“You have no power… yet I will grant you the power of options.”

A pause. And then ; two options, delivered like sacred scripture carved into stone:

---

**“Option One:”**

“Refuse the deal. Walk away. I will leave you be. You will never hear from me again.”

“But Haoyu will die tomorrow. And Dallas will rot in prison until his final, forgotten breath. I will engulf Steven ; body, soul, and spirit ; and I will haunt all 22 members of the Echofall project whom you worked with: Yuyan, Pragnya… all of them.”

“And I will take Haoyu’s children. His wife. I will sink them into eternal torment, as payment for the echoes your mission unleashed.”

---

**”Option Two:”**

The voice deepened. Slowed. Became intentional.

“Find me the artifact. The guitar given to Dallas Red by the Oc’Xari.”

“If you choose this option… I will create an event that delays Haoyu’s execution by one week.”

“Bring me the artifact, and I will reverse time ; thirty years back, to before your rover ever landed on the meteor.”

“I will wipe everyone’s memories, except yours.”

“You will be in charge of intercepting the rover. That meteor was a one-in-a-billion anomaly ; the only chance to find Nhexus. There will never be another.”

“The suffering… the madness… all of it, erased.”

“The timeline reset.”

“You, and you alone, will carry the memory of what once was.”

“And I will leave this planet alone, forever. Let it wither naturally, the way it should have ; a barely habitable little rock in a messy solar system that would’ve never been an appropriate habitat for life. It’s a miracle Earth made it this far.”

---

Dmitry stumbled on Option Two, brow furrowed, jaw clenched. He stepped forward from the dim haze and spoke out in protest to the pig:

“A guitar? That makes no sense. You want to play with AC/DC? Chat’s the catch here?”


“Couldn’t a being like you ; the so-called Creator of the Universe ; just make a new one? If you can just turn back time, can’t you turn it back to before they made the canon and just prevent this conversation we are having right now?”

The Pig hummed. Not angrily, but in a way that almost sounded like respect. A dark, unsettling admiration.

“Fair questions.”


“You see, the seed I created ; the true seed of the universe ; I control. I architect the stars. I carve out time. I shape elements, dictate cycles, define physics, weave fate.”

“But the life that created the LUCA seed... was a bug. A corruption. An anomaly in the divine algorithm.”

“Even I, a superbeing outside time, cannot fully predict what they’ve done. They created life without purpose. Life without structure. They had no idea what they were doing! The universe is very complex, and they were arrogant enough to think they could save life. They dared to inject chaos into a system I spent longer than time itself perfecting.”

“And then, they went extinct, vanishing into the void after launching their seed cannons ; abandoning their malformed children to rot on planets like Nhexus.”

The room vibrated slightly as the pig continued, voice thick with ancient, cosmic rage:

“But the artifact created by the Oc’Xari ; I cannot recreate, as it’s not from my seed.”


“It is linked to their species. Every strand of DNA, every molecule, every spore.”
”The Oc’Xari are an immortal essence, they will stain my realm forever.”

“I need a link. The artifact is connected to their collective hive mind, and the location it was spawned is the gateway. If I possess it in the right location... I can wipe out the entire Oc’Xari race. Instantly. Irrevocably.”

“Like fumigating a nest of vermin.”

---

Dmitry stood frozen, the breath caught in his throat.

His mind spun ; reeling through everything he’d heard, everything he’d *witnessed*. The vast scope of the universe. The deaths. The dreams. The suffering. The pig.

And now… genocide?

His voice cracked, quieter than before.

“You want me to pick between saving my friends… and the extinction of an ancient alien species?”

The Pig snapped back immediately ; not with wrath, but with something worse: annoyance. 

“The Oc’Xari invaded your planet over a decade ago.”


“There are millions of them ; not in ships, not in cities ; but molded into your planet's atmosphere. They are in the winds, the wires, the oceans, and yes… even in your teeth.”

“And your *retarded human leaders* did nothing. They ignored it and blamed it on your Commander, obliterating his life. And you ; you don't even know. You designed the stupid rover Dmitry, you held the controller, launching it out into space, landing it onto a meteor that flew to Nhexus, and now the Oc’Xari invades your planet like spies, why would you pity the death of cancer.” The Pig accidentally admitting it was Dmitry’s fault Commander Zhang’s life was ruined.

Dmitry avoided the thought - it was him piloting a big part of the mission that led to all this.

A low hum of disgust vibrated through the air like a sub-bass growl.

“The Oc’Xari have done this a thousand times before. To a thousand worlds ; long dead before your Earth learned to crawl.”


“They linger. Observe. Infiltrate. And when they find life, they don’t destroy it. They just sit there. Watching.”

“They embed. Wait. Until the planet dies.”

“They are the parasitic spyware of my realm ; and I’m sick of playing cat and mouse with a virus that I have to endlessly chase around the void.”

“Do you have any idea how hard it is to eradicate a species that behaves like that?”


“You can't burn them. You can't trap them. They watch through mirrors. They move through static and they are everywhere.”

“This guitar artifact ; created by their own hands ; is connected to all of them… it is a node I can use to end them. Forever.”

The silence that followed felt cosmic. Heavy.

Dmitry stood there. Heart racing.

And the Pig's voice softened ; almost calm.

“This isn’t about vengeance, Dmitry. It’s about cleaning up a broken system.”


“The LUCA Seed was an infection.”

“The Oc’Xari is the echo.”

“And you… may behold the cure.”

---

Dmitry evaluates his options,
he looks back at Haoyu in his cell, still whimpering - insane, crazed, looking like some zombie or hysterical goblin rather than a human,

Dmitry looks to the silhouette of Steven - "What do you think Steven?"

Steven shifted in the shadows. His silhouette twitched slightly ; still bound by something not visible, something slick, something hungry. A tremble ran through his voice as he spoke, barely above a whisper:

“I ain’t no saint, Lex…”


“But I ain’t a devil neither.”

“But then again... Will you let your commander die screaming in a hole? Will you let his wife and *kids* suffer? Will you let Pragnya, Yuyan, the rest of ‘em all rot in eternal hell... just ‘cause you were too soft to make the hard call?”

“That thing…” ; he glanced into the dark behind him ; “It don’t *play*. It don’t *forget*. It don’t *forgive*.”

“And maybe the Oc’Xari didn’t shoot no bullets... but if what he says is true… if they’re really everywhere, watchin’, listenin’, passively waitin’ for us to die, just gathering intel, who knows, maybe the Oc’Xari has a plan with all this to eventually overtake the universe, and take ownership from the guy who created it...”

“...Then maybe someone’s gotta finally pull the damn plug.”

Steven looked up at Dmitry. His eyes were watery, hollow.

“I don’t know what the right answer is, man.”


“But I know what happens if you do nothing.”

He swallowed hard.

“We lose everything.”

Dmitry cleared his throat, voice shaky but grounded.

“I have a couple concerns about the deal. Do you know where the guitar artifact is? Or do I have to find it? And… when I get it; where do I meet you to hand it over?”

The Pig’s voice slithered in response, calm and calculated:

“The artifact remains in a small, relatively unguarded police station in Swift Current, Saskatchewan; not far from the barn where your base was raided.


I cannot interact with items crafted from foreign seeds myself; if I could, I would have taken it already. I could possess a police officer, compel them to bring it to me… 

But I am a fair trader of deals. And I enjoy the humor in poetic justice.

You, Steven, and your beloved Commander spent over 20 years searching for life. You opened the door. You revealed your planet’s position to the Oc’Xari. And you in the Oc’Xari became best friends as it projected you onto all sorts of different worlds you should have never seen. You invited me here.

So it is only fitting that you be given the honor of seeing this through.

Once you have the artifact, return to Dallas Red’s old barn.

I’ll be waiting.

You have seven days.”

Dmitry asked again; “Why only 7, can’t we get an extension?”

“Ask Mississippi execution protocol for why they can only postpone Class A executions by a week, this is the best I can do… Don’t be late.”

And just like that- the pigs aura vanished. The Haoyu mirage was gone.

The corner was empty.

Steven stood there, chest heaving, finally letting out a massive, overdue breath; as if he’d been holding it since the beginning of time.

The deal had been made.

### **III. A Glimpse of Hope**

Steven was still catching his breath, his hands on his knees, the echo of the Pig’s presence still crawling on his skin.

“I… I just went to bed,” he stammered, eyes darting around the basement like he still wasn’t sure he was awake.


“Had a bad dream. Next thing I know, I’m *here*. Watching you swap out a mop head… with a goddamn demon pig behind me.”

Dmitry stared at him, still processing.

“I haven’t seen you since the jail cafeteria. How the hell did you get to Seattle?”

Steven looked down at his own clothes ; flip-flops, beach shorts, a wrinkled T-shirt. He hadn’t changed. He hadn’t packed. He hadn’t boarded a plane. He just… was here.

“I’m.. what? I’m in Seattle? I don’t know, man,” he said. “I was in Florida like five minutes ago. Now I’m in this basement with you, haven’t even seen you, or heard from you since we got out of prison 8 years ago, and now the Devil’s making us choose between time travel and mass extinction.”

They stood in silence.

The hum of the basement fluorescent lights filled the void.

Eventually, Dmitry muttered:

“It wasn’t a hallucination. He’s real. And we made a deal.”

Steven nodded, quietly.

“We got seven days to get to Swift Current,” he said. “Get that damn guitar. Take it to the barn. And maybe… save Haoyu.”

“And wipe an entire alien race out of existence.”

“No pressure.”

They locked eyes.

Old teammates. Broken men.

Eight years apart. But it didn’t matter now.

“We need a plan,” Dmitry said.

“Right now,” Steven agreed.

They were back in it.

---

In Mississippi Supermax - the execution scheduled to happen in a few hours - the warden in charge gets an emergency call to handle bureaucratic matters off in North Dakota - he postpones the execution by a week… as he marks it off, stamps it, and sent the memo out to the facility, he whispers to himself in pity… “That poor bastard has to suffer another week, I’m sorry for the delay Commander Zhang.”

# Chapter 35 - Back in Action

### I. Another Day at the Office

**Seattle - 4:07 a.m.**

The city was silent except for the hum of flickering street lamps and the occasional siren in the distance.

Dmitry and Steven stood outside the shuttered entrance of a 24-hour discount store ; one of those ghetto-lit holes in the wall that sold off-brand toothpaste and knockoff batteries. With what little cash they scraped together ; grocery money, overdue rent ; they picked up:

- Two cheap reusable backpacks (*if you could call a garbage bag a backpack*)
- A flashlight
- Gloves
- Some canned beans and protein bars
- A box cutter
- Cheap socks
- A couple $2 lighters
- 2 cheap blankets

They didn’t have much. But they had *a mission*.

---

**Dmitry’s Apartment - 5:03 a.m.**

The apartment reeked of mildew, cheap incense, weed and cigarettes. The hallway was lined with stained carpet and cracked drywall. Apartment 303 ; Dmitry’s ; was more rust than door.

They slipped inside. Steven muttered under his breath.

“Looks nicer than my place.”

“At least you have a beach,” Dmitry replied, without humor.

The lights buzzed. A dying fridge growled in the corner.

Dmitry knelt under the sink, pulling out a toolkit caked with grease and dirt ; mostly car repair junk from a past life. He slid out a rusty crowbar, and an old greasy pipe wrench.

Then he paused. His voice dropped to a whisper.

“Next door. Lives an illegal narcotics trafficker, low time gangster. He waves a Glock around in the parking lot when he’s yelling at other thugs, we should go get it...”

Steven looked at him like he’d just offered to rob a church.

“You serious, man? We’re gonna knock off a damn drug lord at sunrise?”

Dmitry stared straight ahead.

“We have no car. No gun. No passports. No help. We just have the pig.”

“So yeah. I’m serious.”

He handed Steven the crowbar. Kept the pipe wrench for himself.

They both put on gloves.

“You sure he’s asleep?” Steven asked.

“I’m not sure about anything anymore.”

![u8296664269_hotel_corridor_endless_perspective_dirty_brown_ca_c0d16ebc-f69b-440a-ac0b-73f22b0e3ae3_0.png](Chapter%2035%20-%20Back%20in%20Action/u8296664269_hotel_corridor_endless_perspective_dirty_brown_ca_c0d16ebc-f69b-440a-ac0b-73f22b0e3ae3_0.png)

---

**Apartment 304 - 5:11 a.m.**

The door creaked open under the crowbar’s force. 

Inside: hot, dark, and thick with the stench of chemicals, baking soda, drywall and burnt plastic.

The only sound was deep, *wet* snoring and a TV playing movies on maximum volume.

The man ; a local dealer with half a dozen priors ; lay unconscious on the sagging couch, one arm draped over a half-empty bottle of gin, the other lazily resting across a bong.

They moved like **ghosts**.

Dmitry crouched low, zeroing in on a duffel bag crumpled beside the couch. He unzipped it with surgical precision.

**Inside:** bricks of cash - mostly dollar bills, baggies of powder, a balled-up hoodie soaked in something brown… and buried beneath it all:

A black semi-auto pistol. Two magazines. Full.

He passed the Glock and mags to Steven.

“You’re the redneck. You shoot.”

“Great,” Steven whispered. “All I wanted was pancakes this week, now I’m on the frontlines.”

They kept searching ; fast, silent, methodical. Steven headed into the kitchen, noticing a brick of crack-cocaine laying on a countertop scale. He cracked open the fridge, opened the jar of pickles, started munching as he raided for more food. Dmitry was in the bathroom, snatched a first-aid kit and a bottle of bleach. He peaked in a cabinet under the sink ; jackpot:

A homemade Mac-10, crudely welded from random steel sheets and pipes.


A dull, but wickedly serrated combat knife, taped to the back of the cabinet.

And a rusted metal toolkit, heavier than it looked.

Dmitry popped it open.

Ammo. Loose rounds. Stacked and rattling.

He grinned grimly, eyes gleaming with sudden purpose. He carefully began closing the kit, and he lifted it up, until… 

**CLANG—CLACK—**

The handle snapped.

The box dropped.

And bullets exploded across the linoleum like metal hail.

Steven’s head jerked up.

“Oh fuck…”

Too late.

The drug dealer stirred, coughing himself awake, eyes blearily snapping open-

“HUH—HEY—WHAT THE FU—”

**CRACK.**

Steven didn’t hesitate.

The **crowbar** came down hard across the man’s temple.

**CRACK.**

Again.

**CRACK.**

A third time.

The dealer crumpled sideways off the couch like a sack of bones. Whether dead or unconscious didn’t matter. They had 30 seconds max.

“CYKA BLYAT!!” Dmitry barked, diving to scoop up handfuls of ammo, stuffing them into his already-ripping dollar store backpack, which now strained at every seam.

Steven grabbed the duffel bag, shoved some food inside, and followed him out the door-

No time to think. No time to clean. No time to breathe.

---

**Amtrak Yards - 6:04 a.m.**

They ran until their lungs burned.

The train was moving ; slow, groaning like a beast awakening ; crawling north out of the yard.

**Destination: Canada.
Objective: The Artifact.
Deadline: Seven Days.**

And the Pig was waiting.

Dmitry spotted a rear car with a maintenance ladder. Unlocked.

“You still got your climbing arms, cowboy?”

“Hell no,” Steven grunted. “But let’s roll.”

They hoisted themselves up, climbed inside.

Dark. Cold. But safe. For now.

The train clanked and jerked forward ; picking up speed.

“Time to cover up” said Dmitry, as they pulled the blankets out of their bags, a few bullets spilling out of the holes of Dmitrys backpack… He took out the medical tape from the first aid kit to patch up his bag, scrambling to fetch the bullets that fell out of the seams.

Then, the two of them hid, laid low between the crates being lugged to Canada, and covered themselves with their blankets. Beside some other sacks of goods, they blended in.

**Somewhere Outside Langley, British Columbia**

**8:57 a.m.**

The train hissed as it rolled to a crawl, the wheels squealing against a tight bend in the track. Outside the steel door, muffled voices drifted in:

“Langley yard’s backed up; tell dispatch we’re rerouting to Vancouver…”


“Yeah, we’ll offload two cars up the line. Should be clear in twenty.”

Steven and Dmitry crouched low in the storage car. The moment the workers’ footsteps faded into silence, the two men exchanged a look.

“We ain't tryna see no damn Vancouver,” Steven whispered.

Dmitry cracked the door open an inch.

Through the slit: sunlight. Trees. The outskirts of Langley, brush and uneven patches of dense bushland stretching beyond the tracks.

The train lurched forward again; slow, steady, not yet gaining speed.

“We should jump out into these bushes and trees.” Dmitry muttered.
”Fuck” said Steven.

They leapt.

Boots hit gravel.

Dirt kicked up.

And within seconds they were gone, swallowed by the undergrowth, ghosting into the green bush with bags slung and weapons hidden beneath oversized thrift-store jackets.

---

**Langley - 9:34 a.m.**

They’d made it.

In Canada.

With a duffel full of cash, dry goods, homemade explosives, and two illegally possessed firearms, one of which ; the Mac-10 ; would get them life in prison just for touching it.

They stuck to alleyways, fences, and powerline trails. The early hour and the fog of winter morning worked in their favor.

“We need wheels,” Dmitry said, eyes scanning the backstreets.

They found it in a cracked lot behind a shuttered vape shop: an old, dented electric sedan, paint peeling, one headlight duct-taped. A 26th-century beater, just begging to be stolen.

“You ever hotwire a self-start ignition AI lock?” Steven asked.

“No,” Dmitry said, pulling the crowbar from his bag.

“But I once reprogrammed a Martian orbital survey drone using a toaster and a credit card. So yes.”

He jammed the crowbar between the body of the car and doorframe. He pries open a gaping hole between them. Metal screamed. He shoved a hand through the gap and unlocked the door manually.

Inside, he cracked open the steering column, yanked out the embedded chip interface, and rigged together a loopback bypass using two wires, a pocket knife, and one of the 9mm bullets.

The dash lit up.

The car blinked.

It purred to life with a low whir.

“You stole us a car, Tech Wizard,” Steven said, climbing in.
”It’s not stolen, we are just borrowing it.” Justified Dmitry.
”Yeah, we’ll bring it back… for sure.” Steven agreed.

---

**Somewhere Eastbound, British Columbia Highway 1**

**10:12 a.m.**

The sun crept over the distant Cascade mountain range as the stolen vehicle tore through early-morning fog. Trees gave way to plains. Civilization thinned. The radio was off. The engine hummed.

**Destination**: Swift Current, Saskatchewan.


**Distance:** ~1,700 kilometers.

**Time:** ~19 hours, nonstop.

They had food.

They had weapons.

They had cash.

And nothing left to lose.

“Echofall Project, final mission,” Steven muttered, peering at the road ahead.


“Find the guitar.

Finish the deal.

Save the Commander.”

Dmitry added… “and wipe out an entire alien civilization”

“all in a days work” followed up Steven

# Chapter 36 - British Columbia

---

### **I. Kelowna, BC**

**13:43 - Day One**

The plan was simple. A straight shot east through British Columbia. About 300 kilometers to the next major city; Kelowna. They expected to arrive within three hours.

Instead, it took them seven.

By hour two, the Coquihalla Highway revealed its true nature ; a serpent of black ice and fog-choked turns winding through sheer cliffs and snow-pummeled passes. The electric sedan, already on its last legs, slid, groaned, and twitched beneath them. They crawled along at slow speeds, not daring to make a mistake.

Visibility dropped to five meters at best through the thick smoke-like fog.

They passed two jackknifed trucks, one flipped hatchback, and a cluster of abandoned snowed in SUVs. Somewhere near the summit, the snowfall turned to sleet, the sleet to pellets, and then to an eerie stillness as fog swallowed the mountain.

Neither spoke for most of the drive out of tension and survival instinct.

By the time they rolled into Kelowna, it was well after dark. The streets glistened under ice, and the city felt more like an outpost clinging to the edge of some frozen frontier.

<The Coquihalla Highway>

---

**21:11 - Kelowna, Downtown Edge**

“We should park somewhere random, and walk around to look for a shitty motel that doesn’t have any cameras.” said Steven.

So, Dmitry turned into a dead-end side street, flanked by dumpsters and shuttered repair shops. They parked, wiped down every surface they’d touched with a bleach soaked ragged, and locked the doors manually.

The street was dead silent.

“If someone finds it, we’re just two tired drunks who take the bus.” Dmitry muttered.

They kept their duffel bag of weapons and essentials, leaving behind the leftover food and frivolous electronics.

They walked six blocks through ice-slicked sidewalks and empty strip mall lots until they reached it.

---

**21:28 - Sleepy Pines Motor Inn**

A flickering neon sign. Half the letters dead.

The building looked more like a converted sanitarium than a hotel.

A woman with matted bleach hair stood barefoot outside one room, chain-smoking in a silk robe. Another man, shirtless despite the cold, was arguing with a broken vending machine. 

Steven spoke up as they walked by it “Lex, look at this place - a Crackwhores paradise.”

They entered, the front desk smelled like cat piss… but they took cash.

And more importantly ; no cameras.

They handed over enough bills for one night, no questions asked. The clerk didn’t even blink at the stack of 1$ American bills.

Inside, their room was musty, stained, and reeked faintly of old sex.

Steven collapsed onto the bed, still in his coat, pulling the pistol from his waistband and setting it on the nightstand.

“Man… Coquihalla’s a hell of a bitch.”


“That road’s got more ghosts than we do.”

Dmitry didn’t respond. He was already checking the seams of the motel room windows, checking the bathroom, verifying the vents didn’t have any hidden cameras or microphones, double-locking the front door, and moving a chair in front of it.

Only after the room felt secure did he sit on a sofa and whisper:

“This was supposed to be easy…”


“Just one checkpoint.”

Steven gave a low chuckle, dry as sand.

“Yeah. And next one’s just the Canadian prairies.”


“Flat, cold, empty… and full’a demons.”

Outside, the wind howled across the parking lot, and snow began to fall again.

The motel room settled into silence.

Steven pulled the scratchy blanket over his chest. Dmitry’s sofa creaked as he finally leaned back, pistol within reach. They both exhaled slowly, trying to let the day drain from their bones.

The light was turned off.

Stillness.

Darkness.

Almost peaceful.

**Click.**

The light in the bathroom flicked on.

Both men blinked; groggy, half-asleep; their eyes drifting to the thin line of light seeping out from under the closed bathroom door.

They stared at the gap under the door.

A shadow passed behind the door.

And then it stopped.

The shade of two feet.

Just barely visible from the bottom slit of the door, stationary, silent.

Neither man breathed.

And then, without ceremony, the Pig spoke.

The voice oozed with disdain, but also… something else.

A hint of injured pride.

As if *it*… the *Pig*… wanted *them* to feel like the real monsters.

“You would save the lives of thirty mortals… people who will all be dead within eighty years…”


“And in return… you would *wipe out* an entire species… the **Oc’Xari**, spread across thousands of galaxies, in numbers your little brain couldn’t even count.”

“And *you*… *you dare to judge me*… for tormenting a handful of souls?”

“I who aim to correct the infection… to purge the spyware… to repair what was broken when your ancestors tampered with my blueprint?”
”I built a Pyramid of flesh upon Nhexus to destabilize the sun, I saved them from their eternal sorrow.”
”And you are selfish pests, easily controlled by threats towards your friends and family.”

Steven didn’t even sit up. Just exhaled flatly:

“Well… goodnight to you too.”

The voice hissed like a dying vent pipe.

“Six days.”

Click.

The bathroom light went out.

And the shadow vanished.

The motel was dark again.

Steven turned his face into the pillow.

Dmitry rubbed his eyes, then stared up at the ceiling.

“What’s it take to get a good night’s sleep around here…”

Neither one slept for a while.

### **II. Revelstoke**

---

By some miracle, they actually did fall asleep.

The alarm clock in the motel room started blaring at 10:15 AM probably set by some methed-out guest from a previous night.

At least they got to sleep in a bit.

They stirred awake, groggy and sore, limbs aching from motel mattresses older than both of them combined. Breakfast came out of their duffel bags ; crushed granola bars, a half-eaten bag of trail mix, an energy drink warm from being in someone’s coat pocket too long.

They brushed their teeth using dollar-store brushes, washed their armpits and ass cracks in the sink… a “Whore’s Bath” they called it, with the awkwardness of two grown men trying to remain human while living like ghosts.

Then, back out to the cold.

Their stolen beater car was still parked half a dozen blocks away, right where they’d left it. Untouched. Not even ticketed.

Steven remarked: “She waited for me.” 

They climbed in. The engine coughed awake.

“Next stop…” Dmitry said, hot wiring the car to get the heater going.


“Calgary?” Steven added, with a big, sarcastic question mark.

“Yeah… Dallas and Haoyu will be waiting at the airport like last time.” Dmitry muttered, remembering how Kelowna turned from a three-hour drive into seven thanks to the Coquihalla’s frozen wrath.

And so, they hit the road.

It wasn’t *as* bad as the previous night’s ice trek, but it still sucked.

As they rolled past the ragged skeletons of pine trees, and through winding mountain stretches, they entered a run-down town that looked like Detroit’s cracked-out cousin.

The sign read:

**VERNON**

Steven’s brow furrowed. He leaned out the window slightly.

“What a shithole.” he commented flatly.

They didn’t stop.

Another hour or so passed.

![vernon.png](Chapter%2036%20-%20British%20Columbia/vernon.png)

As they drove alongside the mirror-calm water of Mara Lake near Sicamous, Steven locked his eyes on the iced-over expanse.

“Looks like Florida.” he said, squinting at the frozen lake surface. “If Florida had snow instead of sand, pines instead of palms, and a few thousand mountains shoved up its ass.”

The road twisted again, higher now. The snow on the roadside deepened. Trees began closing in.

After some time, Revelstoke came into view ; if you could *call* it a city. More like just a gas station and a couple buildings awkwardly pretending to be civilization, surrounded by snow-drowned mountains.

They pulled in for fuel.

The air smelled of diesel, pine, and wet gravel.

As Dmitry started pumping gas, a law enforcement emergency vehicle rolled up. A single officer got out, wearing a high-vis jacket and looking cold, tired, and indifferent to the universe.

Steven started panicking, hand on the glock in his waistband.

Dmitry’s stomach plummeted as the officer approached.

“Hey ; just a heads-up,” the officer said casually.


“There was an avalanche just east of here, and there’s a heavy snowstorm warning between us and Calgary. The roads are closed. If I were you? I’d hunker down here for the night.”

Without waiting for a response, the officer turned and strolled into the gas station mini-mart.

Dmitry let out a long, tension-fueled breath.

“Whew… that was a close one.”

Steven ungripped his glock, relaxed, and leaned back in the passenger seat, looking at the snow-clouds rolling in overhead.

“Guess we’re staying in Gas Station Toilet Buttfuck Mountain Town tonight,” he said with that same deadpan Florida charm.

A short drive later, they found the nearest motel.

It looked newer than the last one, but the price was almost double. Still rundown, still half-buried in snow, but at least the neon vacancy sign was on.

Dmitry planned; “Let’s go in, if we can get a room, lets come back out and move the car.”

Inside the lobby, the air smelled pleasant of pine and Christmas scents. The staff behind the counter seemed immediately annoyed when Dmitry tried to pay with American cash.

“We don’t accept cash,” the clerk said with suspicion, glancing at their unshaven faces, ratty coats, and generally apocalyptic look.

But the pleading from Dmitry, and Steven’s annoyed:

“You want us to die in a snowstorm?”

…somehow swayed the man’s logic.

With great reluctance, the clerk counted the stack of dollar bills and slid them a keycard.

---

As soon as the motel key was in their hands, Dmitry told Steven “I’m going to move the car.” as he bolted out the door, leaving Steven behind in the lobby.

He ran out to where his stolen beater was parked, engine still warm under the snowfall. First thing he did was wipe down the steering wheel, gearshift, door handles, dash; everything; with a bleach-soaked rag he pulled from a ziplock bag.

The scent was harsh. Acrid. Chemical paranoia in cloth form.

He peeled out the glove compartment contents, tore out any receipts, wrappers, gum, anything that might even *hint* at who they were. Tossed it all into a grocery bag, stuffed it in a public trash bin down the street. Then he backed the car out, turned down a residential back road, and parked it five blocks away beneath a snow-heavy cedar tree.

Dmitry wiped the door handles again for good measure, shut it softly, and pulled up his hoodie.

He was about halfway back when he looked down.

Footprints.

His boots were punching clear, deep marks into the fresh powder.

He froze - Paranoia overwhelming…

Then sighed.

“Snowstorm’s coming anyway,” he muttered to himself.


“They’ll be buried within an hour.”

He kept jogging, breath puffing white in the mountain air. By the time he made it back to the motel, snow had already started drifting sideways. The storm was arriving right on cue.

Inside, a warm, log cabin, ski resort type room, with a rocking chair, wooden beds, and a few animal taxidermy heads hung on the walls. Steven was already relaxed, lying sideways on the double bed, TV flickering blue light across his face as some ancient sitcom played.

“They got a deer head, bear head, fox head… no pig head.” Steven observed.

“The pig should come and protest. Put up a pig head or die in eternal hellfire.” Dmitry joked as he kicked off his boots, locked the door, and got to work.

He dragged the wooden chair from the corner across the carpet and jammed it under the doorknob, just like before. Then made his rounds ; opening drawers, sliding back the curtains an inch, checking vents, peeking into the motel closet, opening the bathroom, peeking behind the shower curtain. No shadows. No whispers. 

He let out a slow, heavy sigh and finally settled near the end of the bed, still tense.

“You think Piggie’s gonna be in the bathroom this time,” he asked, “or hiding in the closet to give his nightly sermon?”

Steven smirked without looking up from the TV.

“I dunno, man. I hope he’s out there preaching to the snowstorm. Maybe it’ll make a deal with it to fuck off.”

Dmitry chuckled and leaned his head back against the wall.

The wind outside began to howl like wolves.

But for now, at least, the room was quiet.

---

Five days.

That’s what they thought, murmured, and etched silently in their minds before the motel room dimmed into sleep.

The night wasn’t quiet, but it was strangely peaceful. The blizzard howled like a pack of arctic beasts outside their thin motel walls, winds screaming, snow pelting sideways like a million shattered needles. But the room was warm, smelled like pine, the mattress soft.

They slept like babies.

Dreamless, merciful sleep.

---

8:30 AM

A mechanical buzzing from the nightstand clock. Annoying and shrill.

Steven groaned.

Dmitry sat up slowly, swung his legs off the side of the bed, and blinked the blur from his vision.

He walked to the window and drew the curtain back just a crack.

“Well, shit,” he muttered.

A solid sheet of white covered the town. Cars, sidewalks, lamp posts; everything had been buried beneath what looked like ten feet of fresh powder. And it was still falling. The wind still shrieking.

Behind him, Steven was rubbing his face.

“How’s it look, Captain?” he asked, voice still lazy with sleep.

Dmitry didn’t turn away from the glass.

“There’s not a single car moving through the snow. Not one. Roads are dead.”

Steven reached lazily for the TV remote, flicked it on; static.

He flipped through the channels. Still static.

“Guess the storm took out cable.”

He pulled out his phone. “No bars.”

They both sighed in sync.

They chewed through dry granola bars, cracked open a couple bottles of water, and took turns showering for real this time; long, hot, quiet showers, washing away the stale motel stink of yesterday’s survival. The storm boomed like war drums outside, but inside, they were trying to pretend; just for a moment; that this was normal.

By 10:55, they packed up their gear and went down to check out.

---

The lobby was crowded.

Couples in parkas. Families. Older folks still in pajamas. Travelers with sleds. A woman clutching a suitcase and her teacup poodle. All gathered around a uniformed man in a blue parka; his badge visible.

It was the same officer from the gas station the day before.

His voice was calm, professional, trying to carry authority and friendliness all at once.

“Last night,” he said, “an avalanche took out a few of our local cell towers. Luckily, nobody was hurt. But I do need to give you an update about the weather.”

Dmitry and Steven exchanged a glance.

“This storm…” the officer continued, “is not your average snow dump. They’re calling it a superstorm. One of the worst to ever hit the interior. It’s expected to rage for the next four to five days. That’s the forecast, and believe me; if it clears up sooner, we’ll let you know.”

There were groans.

Some gasps.

One guy at the back dropped his suitcase and muttered, “Jesus Christ.”

The officer raised a hand.

“I know it’s not what you want to hear. But we do have some good news. The province of British Columbia has declared this an emergency weather lockdown, and the government will fully compensate your motel stay until the storm ends.”

Half the room cheered. The other half muttered curses.

“So,” he smiled, trying to lighten the mood, “think of this as an unexpected free vacation. Revelstoke’s a beautiful place this time of year. We’ve got some great little craft breweries, world-class snowboarding slopes, a couple steakhouses, a hotspring thermal bathhouse, cozy cabins, and a museum for anyone who likes a bit of local history. Try to make the most of it, folks.”

He smiled again and turned to speak with the desk staff.

![u8296664269_police_officer_in_hotel_lobby_speaking_with_crowd_a8e28498-3c70-4687-906e-9deb37ab1ce2_3.png](Chapter%2036%20-%20British%20Columbia/u8296664269_police_officer_in_hotel_lobby_speaking_with_crowd_a8e28498-3c70-4687-906e-9deb37ab1ce2_3.png)

---

Dmitry and Steven stood near the edge of the crowd, still as statues.

“Five days…” Dmitry whispered.

“We’ve got five days left to make it over the mountains to Calgary…”


“...And another 500 clicks through prairie roads to Swift Current.”

“And we’re stuck in a frozen tourist trap.”


“All because some cosmic entity is pissed about intergalactic spyware.”

Steven blinked, expression blank.

“We’re so fucked,” he said.

Dmitry exhaled.

“Wanna… go back to the room and… I don’t know…”

“Yeah,” Steven nodded.


“Let’s just go… figure out how doomed we are.”

They turned, pushed back through the crowd, and climbed the stairs.

The snowstorm roared outside like it wanted to eat the world.

# Chapter 37 - The Great Canadian Wilderness

### **I. Free Vacation**

They sat in the motel room, silent, almost statues.

The heater hummed in the background, muffled by the *thump-thump* of windblown snow against the windows. Steven fiddled with the remote again; still static. Dmitry’s fingers drummed against the window frame, stared outside as if he expected the storm to magically clear up.

“Still white,” he muttered.


“Still nothing.”

No cars. No movement. Just snow swallowing a town.

But then… his eyes caught a sliver of something.

A sign poking out from a drift; barely readable, crusted in frost.

DOWNTOWN 50m AHEAD

Through the haze, he could just make out the rooftops of what passed for Revelstoke’s downtown. A small cluster of buildings. Maybe twenty. One with a glowing red “Open” sign flickering.

“You wanna check out the town?” Dmitry asked.

Steven groaned.

“We’re gonna rot with Haoyu in eternal torture anyway.”

Dmitry gave him a sideways look.

“Well, I won’t. Just you guys will.”

Steven chuckled dryly.

“Oh yeah… that was in the fine print of Option 1.”


“What; you didn’t want to make your own deal to at least save me?”

Dmitry smirked.

“Nyet. You deserve it.”

Steven cackled, half-hearted and cold.

---

They got dressed in what barely passed for winter gear; cheap, dollar-store beanies, faux synthetic-wool gloves, plastic-lined jackets with insulation thinner than paper towel. Steven’s boots still had a tag from ValueZone.

They trudged out of the motel and into the howling white, pushing into the wind like old men on a death march.

Fifty meters felt like five hundred.

But finally; downtown Revelstoke.

A dozen touristy shops, all with cozy hand-carved signage. One craft brewery with lights on inside, and a sign outside offering “Blizzard Specials.” A few kids sliding across frozen sidewalks, throwing snowballs, laughing. The only vehicles in sight were half-buried.

Then they saw it; a snowboarding and outdoor gear store, bigger than the rest. Like a quaint Bass Pro Shop squeezed into a mountain town with a population of three thousand.

Outside the front doors - lined up were two expensive, high tech snowmobiles. 

“These are pretty heavy duty, you could probably drive this through a mud bog in Louisiana.” explained Steven as he sat on one, admiring the quality of the build.

“Let’s see what else they have.” Dmity said, as they ducked inside.

Warmth hit them like a wave. Fireplace, cabin lighting. Bright. Cozy.

Rows of gear lined the walls; jackets, boots, helmets, snowboards, tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, skis, goggles, gloves, socks, water filters, solar panels. A survivalist’s paradise.

Steven walked over to one of the first jackets on display. A sleek, high visibility orange, tech-insulated parka, wrapped in what looked like a hybrid of thermal alloy and carbon mesh. Sleek shoulder plating. Inner heating coils.

“Damn…” he whispered.


He flipped the tag.

“Eight thousand dollars.”

Dmitry glanced over and shot him a glare.

“Blyat. That’s worth more than the car we borrowed from Langley.”

They turned. And there it was; a wall of snowshoes, heat-treated boots, thermal gloves, and snow pants lined with silver heat film.

A young sales associate, probably no older than twenty, with a lanyard and eager smile, bounced over.

“Hey guys! You looking to do some real snow hiking? These just came in; top of the line, field-rated in Alberta’s wilds!”

Dmitry nodded coolly.

“Yeah, we want to try on the whole outfit. Snowshoes, boots, thermal underwear, gloves, mask; everything.”


“And get sizes for my friend too.”

The kid’s eyes lit up.

“Of course! Right this way; man, you guys are gonna love this stuff. Just got some new kits in from Calgary too, top shelf.”

As the kid went to pull gear from the racks, Steven leaned close and whispered:

“Bro… we have less than 500 bucks in cash.”

Dmitry didn’t look at him.

“No,” he said. “We have credit cards. We can afford it. No problem.”

Steven blinked. 

His face said it all.

“No we d—” - **shhhh** 

And then; he let out an understanding “*ohhhh”*.

---

Ten minutes later, they were fully outfitted. Matching suits of tech-winter armor; insulated, reinforced, sleek. New gloves. Tinted visors. High-tension snowshoes. Beneath it all, high-grade thermal underlayers that regulated body temperature through microcurrent pulses.

Steven struggled to carry a pile of emergency gear; rations, fire kits, a water purification wand, solar heater, couple handheld radios, and a folding survival tent.

They dropped it all at the checkout counter.

The kid grinned. “Let me just start ringing you up-”

He starts scanning a few items, the dollar numbers going up quickly into the tens of thousands,

Dmitry unzipped the duffel bag.

Click.

The barrel of the Mac-10 came out first, followed by Dmitry’s hand, then the fully-loaded mag sliding in with a slap.

He leveled it square at the kid’s face.

“We’re taking all of it,” he said, voice cold as steel.

The kid’s pupils shrunk.

His breath caught in his throat.

He nodded slowly.

“Y–yes… y-you’re taking… all of it.”
”Give us the keys to the snowmobiles, or you die.” Commanded Dmitry.

The young associate shakily handed the keys over.

They grabbed the bags, slinging everything they could carry; Steven muttering obscenities, staggering under the load.

They bolted out the door, into the snow.

Behind them, the kid scrambled for the phone; only to remember.

No signal.

No towers.

No roads.

The only law in Revelstoke now was weather.

And it wasn’t on anybody’s side.

### **II. The Heist**

The air outside slapped them in the face.

Snow came sideways, wind curling like claws. But they didn’t stop.

Just outside the shop, Dmitry passed a key and a radio to Steven, they got onto the snow mobiles, put them into gear.

“Go!” he barked.

They drove. Though the snow deep, powdered, heavy, the snowmobiles crunched through it like a warm knife through butter.

The engine and exhausts huffed steam into the air.

“HOLY SHIT.” Steven yelled through the radio with adrenaline fueling his body “I DIDN’T KNOW WE WERE GONNA DO THAT?!”

Dmitry replied.

“Either we wait here for you to rot in eternal hell, or we take the chance.”

Steven groaned, breath short.

“And the car back in Langley? That wasn’t stolen, that was borrowed...”


He glanced behind them at the store.

“Let me guess. This gear? Borrowed too?”

Dmitry grinned through his chapped lips.

“Of course. We’ll return it.”

“Oh yeah. Yeah, right. Mail it back. Hand-deliver it in twenty years after our space war ends.”

Behind them, muffled by wind, they heard the sales associate’s voice ; faint, *desperate*:

“Help! Thieves! Robbers!”

But the storm swallowed the sounds whole.

His pleas for aid were no more than whispers against the howling gusts.

Just like their tracks, which already vanished beneath fresh powder.

Dmitry glanced behind once, saw only white, and nodded forward.

“This way.”

Ahead of them loomed the edge of town ; where streets gave way to thin trees, then denser woods.

They veered off the road, driving beside in the woods beside it, weaving through frost-covered pines to break up their trail incase anyone was watching, or following… which in this storm… nobody was after them.

“Hey Dmitry, we’ve been driving in the woods for an hour, we should go back on the road, my snowmobile keeps getting snagged in big pockets of snow, bushes and branches”

-With that, they went back onto the main highway. Which wasn’t a road at all, complete snow. But at least there weren’t any trees or shrub. 

### **III. Vast Mountain Roads**

---

They’d make good distance, after a couple hours they’d driven 90 kilometers, slowly through the merciless deep snow. The cold, punishing wind didn't matter. Their jackets were built like small-scale spacesuits: auto-heated cores, built-in A/C channels, some kind of internal sweat-repelling smart fabric that somehow kept their bodies warm and dry.

They pulled over for a rest. Steven took his foot off the pedal, put it in on the road, and it started sinking deep…

“Uhh… Yeah I’m gonna put my snow shoes on, I have no idea how deep this snow is, I might drown in it.” 

Dmitry and Steven both fastened their snow shoes, stretched their legs. 

Dmity breathing deep, a rare smile peeking through cracked lips. Checked the tag on the snow mobile - $20,000.

“Shit… These snowmobiles are nice. And 8000 bucks is a lot for a jacket. But I think it’s actually worth it.”

Steven, nodded and adjusted the collar of his own.

“Yeah, these jackets are amazing. What was the brand on them again?”

Dmitry turned slightly to read the big bold lettered logo on the front of his jacket.

“Archon.”

Steven tilted his head.

“Huh. Sounds like the name of a planet.”

They both laughed. Yeah right- who would name a planet *that.*

“How much did everything cost?” - “Easily over 40k for everything... with the snow mobiles- probably 80k before taxes.”

Their breath fogged in front of them as they sat back down, checking fuel.

“How much fuel do you have Steven?” 

“Uhhh, yeah, it’s like close to empty - about eighth of a tank left.”

“Me too…” Dmitry said stressed out.

“Well, we gotta try and make it to the next town at least…” said Steven.

Without another word, they continued their drive down the highway.

After a while, the landscape opened up around them; vast glaciers like frozen oceans, canyons rimmed with dagger-toothed pine trees, cliffs that looked like cracked stone teeth in the jaw of a sleeping god.

They passed a frozen waterfall, its glassy strands caught mid-fall, gleaming like a crystal chandelier from another dimension.

Beside them: a vast glacial lake, crystalized, encased in a sheet of ice several feet thick. A ripple moved under the surface, or maybe it was just their imaginations.

The sky faded to indigo. Then black.

Their helmet visors, which had seemed like overpriced gimmicks back in the shop, kicked in automatically; night vision activating with a subtle green hue across their display. A small HUD in the lower corner showed temperature, windspeed, direction.

“Did your vision just light up?” Steven asked.

“Yeah these helmets are sweet - I would buy one if I was rich.” Replied Dmitry.

“Well, we are rich today.” Steven replied.

The wind, the weight, the heavy deep snow; it wore on them like gravity.

Some time passed, and Stevens snowmobile came to a halt. 

“What’s wrong?” - Dmitry asked through the radio, a few meters ahead, slowing down.

Steven panicking - trying to turn it back on, the electronics just displaying a red fuel icon - “Shit, I’m out of fuel.”

Dmitry pulled around, beside him - “Get on, let’s keep going.”

“$20,000 left in the dust… was fun.” Steven said upset, trying to climb onto the back of Dmitry’s snow mobile… “You got too much gear, I can’t fit on. We got all my gear too, what are we bringing?”

Dmitry stressing out - looking at the bags of survival gear… “Just put on one backpack, and let’s… let’s tie the bags to the back with a rope, and drag it behind us, we can go slow, keep an eye on it incase something important falls out.”

After Steven tied them to the back, he hopped on the back seat, and they continued their trek.

Another maybe 20 minutes, and Dmitry’s snowmobile also died, ran out of fuel. 

They both get off, put on their snow shoes, with great difficulty as the wind raged on, blowing snow so powerful they could barely see their noses. 

The night was pitch dark, even their night vision helmets didn’t do much good with all the snow.

“Let’s tie the bags around our waists, I guess we walk and we can drag the gear behind us.” said Steven. 

Dmitry panicking and fearfully said; “The Great Canadian Wilderness.” 

They trudged along the thick snow, for a few meters - “I can’t see you, where are you?” Steven asked through the radio… 

“Shit, we should tie a rope between each other so we don’t lose each other, I can’t see anything.” 

They tied a rope amongst themselves and their gear they dragged behind them. And they slowly fought their way through the insane dense snowfall of the superstorm.

At some point, they lost the road as they pushed deeper into the woods, off the roadside path, through a thicket of frozen brush.

“I think we need to setup camp, I have no idea where we are right now, I don’t know when we left the road.” Said Dmitry.

So- with that, they rummaged through their gear. 

Tent. Stakes. Zip. Anchor lines.

Thermal sleeping bags.

No fire. No light. Just warmth and invisibility.

Neither of them spoke much. The exhaustion was in their bones now.

As they each slid into their respective bags inside the tent, wind attacked like a hurricane, damn near blowing them away.

But the gear was expensive, quality, and held strong by some miracle.

# Chapter 38 - Survival

### **I. The Avaris - The Kavariin - The Skybourne Traders**

The Oc’Xari; the cosmic spyware; knew the deal had taken place.

In the moment Dmitry chose to side with the Pig, something ancient and instinctual within the Oc’Xari was triggered: a failsafe panic, the echo of their creators’ last command; survive at all costs.

And so they duplicated.

Not just replication… but supercharged, exponential propagation.

Their threads split like viral fibers, firing in all directions across the galaxy in numbers never before recorded; faster than light, faster than time could witness. They spread themselves through nebulae, black hole coronas, red giant atmospheres, and dormant asteroid clusters in desperate search for a way out.

And in this desperate, last-ditch act; mirroring the reckless hope of the LUCA Canon eons ago; they finally touched something they had never encountered before.

An ancient alien civilization, as old as the first pulses of sentient thought. As old, perhaps, as the Ancients themselves who built the LUCA seed project. But unlike the LUCA seed children, Avaris was untouched. Pure. Original.

The Pig had once spoken of Kavariin to Dmitry, almost reverently.

“I have never interfered with them,” he had said.


“They play by the rules. Their song is true. Their life is real.”

The Avaris had never known war. Never known invasion. Never known there was other life in the universe.

Never met the Pig.

The Oc’Xari, in their blind terror, their swarming chaos, reached Kavariin.

And even there, with all their advancement, the Avaris detected them instantly.

They didn’t respond with lockdowns or military escalations.

There were no sky-taxes.

No fear propaganda.

No political theater-not like on Earth.

Instead, there was simply a signal.

A shared harmonic sent across the planet.

“There is an essence in the sky.


A shadow in the data wind.

Prepare for Protocol Aelion.”

Satellites dimmed. Education domes closed their wings. Cultural sanctuaries paused their performances. The planet folded inwards, gracefully withdrawing from the cosmos.

Dreamers awoke breathless. The skies lost their shimmer. Infants cried for the first time without sound.

A rot was felt in the rhythm of the world.

The Pig had arrived.

For the first time in eternity, the Pig stood; unwelcome, uninvited; on the doorstep of a world that had never broken a rule.

But the Oc’Xari had brought him there.

And he was furious.

“An infection has arrived in your domain,” his voice hissed from the upper thermals, rippling like mold across glass.

The Avaris did not panic.

They formed a council.

They listened.

And then asked, with no fear in their breath:

“What do you want, stranger?”

The Pig snarled.

“I want to cleanse what your world has never known: corruption.”

And somewhere, across the void, on a cold snow-choked road in Canada, Dmitry and Steven walked onward; unaware that their deal had triggered a new reckoning in a part of the universe that had never known darkness.

### **II. Golden**

---

Four days left.

Dmitry and Steven trudged forward along the shoulder of the Trans-Canada Highway, snow crunching under their high-tech boots, bags of gear dragging behind them like a grave they refused to dig. Their breath came in sharp bursts, crystallizing instantly in the frigid air.

A metal sign loomed through the whiteout.

Welcome to Golden.


Calgary – 264km

Steven stopped. His walking stick clattered from his numb fingers.

“What the Hell is so Golden about this place? Huh? We only came 140 kilometers?”

He panted like a dog, shoulders sagging under the weight of exhaustion. Snow flaked off his sleeves, steam rising from the heat vents in his jacket.

Dmitry stood silent.

The wind whistled between them.

He didn’t answer.

He couldn’t.

For the first time since they made the deal... he doubted they would make it.

<Steven on the left, Dmitry on the right… Do they look exactly how you imagined? No? Great!>

**Golden, BC.**

They staggered into town, two frostbitten ghosts dragging bags buried in snow and survival gear. The sight was absurd: two men looking like corporate-sponsored adventurers on the edge of collapse, gear worth more than the entire town block, slushing through the downtown strip toward the only lit-up storefront.

“Bluebird Café.”

They barreled in, door jingling. The barista, an attractive bubbly girl in her twenties, startled at first; then relaxed, seeing the fancy Archon logos on their suits.

Expensive. Corporate. Sponsored.

She assumed they were rich weirdos on a record-breaking arctic trek.

“Wow,” she grinned, “you guys camping out for science or TikTok?”

They nodded vaguely, snow melting off their hoods, puddling at their feet. The café was warm; too warm; the sudden contrast made Steven’s knees weak. He collapsed into a chair as Dmitry leaned against the counter.

“Phone dead,” Steven rasped. “You got a charger?”

“Sure thing,” she chirped. “iOS or ‘Droid?”

“Yes.” said Steven.

She laughed and disappeared behind the counter. A few minutes later, she returned with two steaming mugs of something nostalgic and beautiful. Lattes with the aesthetic leaf drawn into the foam top.

“That’ll cure your frostbite,” she winked.

On the wall behind her, a TV murmured low. Local weather report. Dmitry glanced at it, zoned out, half-listening. He caught something.

“…storm breaking east of Banff… conditions improving toward Calgary…”

He perked up.

“Banff?” he asked. “Where’s that?”

She blinked, confused. “You don’t know Banff?”

Steven leaned in, arms cradling his coffee like a newborn. “Never heard of her. Is she hot?”

“It’s like… the biggest tourist spot in the country.”

“We found Nhexus across the galaxy,” Dmitry muttered. “But not Banff on our own planet.”

They chuckled. Quietly. Weakly.

<The barista at the Bluebird Cafe, Golden BC>

---

After some more small talk, and a few deflections about where they were from and where they were going, they took their mugs to the far back corner. The café’s warm glow didn’t quite reach there ; perfect for scheming.

Dmitry laid it out:

“We’ve walked 140 kilometers in two days. Banff’s another 140. The storm breaks after Banff ; she said it’s clear to Calgary and beyond.”

Steven nodded. “We’ve got four days until the Pig comes to collect.”

“So we walk to Banff. Make it in four days.”

“Then what?”

“We steal another car. Rip it to Swift Current. That’s about 700 kilometers ; doable in one day if the roads are clear.”

Steven thought for a moment.

“So… we walk to Banff. In a blizzard. Across another snow obliterated highway, then Grand Theft Auto across the prairie.”

Dmitry sipped his coffee. “It’s a plan.”

“That’s not a plan,” Steven muttered. “That’s a fever dream in a gas station bathroom.”

“Worked so far.”

They readied their gear, left a fat tip on the counter with stolen drug lord cash; and headed out through the parkade exit behind the café.

They noticed toboggans outside a gas station completely snowed in.

“The station looks closed, there’s nobody here to buy the sleds from…” Steven said.

“We can borrow these too.” Dmitry remarked as he started fixing his gear onto one of the toboggans.

They stepped back onto the highway, gear strapped down onto toboggans pulled behind them, eyes set forward.

“Banff, here we come,” Steven muttered.

And with that, they disappeared once more into the white inferno of Canada’s wilderness.

---

### **III. Banff**

**4 Days Remain**

The highway was little more than a suggestion now; buried beneath drifts that swallowed boots, sled tracks, and willpower alike. The Great Canadian Wilderness towered around them in every direction: jagged tree lines, brittle frozen pines, sheer cliffs slick with icicles like teeth, and valleys crusted in white silence. Mountains loomed on either side, their slopes gouged with old avalanche scars.

Every few kilometers, the wind would rise like a living hydra; damn near creating snow tornados, howling down the pass, screaming through branches, and punching straight through their breath-warmed masks. Visibility dropped to nothing, and they had to follow utility poles and tree blazes just to confirm they were still beside the road.

Each step was a test. Each rest stop was fleeting. They rationed food, shared heat packs, and took turns pulling the sleds; like oxen, silent and resigned.

The first night, they found shelter beneath a shattered old billboard; half a metal frame protruding from the snow, offering just enough break from the wind. They pitched the tent, climbed inside, and ate dry protein rations in silence, listening to the storm tear through the valley like a feral thing.

---

**3 Days Remain**

The next day was more of the same: wind, ice, frostbite threats, and aching joints. They passed long-frozen rivers, entire sections of forest flattened by past slides, and once… a buried highway sign sticking just barely out of the snow: "Welcome to Yoho National Park."

Just past the buried Yoho sign, they stumbled onto another one ; this one half-tipped over and crusted in frost, but still legible:

“Banff ; 1 km”

Steven perked up instantly.

“Dude. One kilometer? We’re there!”

Dmitry’s eyebrows actually rose for the first time in hours. He pulled off a glove, wiped at the sign with his bare hand, and confirmed it.

“It says Banff. Finally…”

Their pace quickened. The road bent, sloped down into a wide glacial stretch. Trees opened. The wind let up.

But what they saw next wasn’t a town. It was a trailhead kiosk, a snowed-in parking lot, and another sign:

**“Welcome to Banff National Park”**

Underneath it read; “Banff Town Center - 47km”

Dmitry stopped - perplexed

Steven squinted.

“Wait… it’s just the park?”

They looked around ; nothing but wilderness, mountains, and white. Banff the *city* was still miles off, probably on the far edge of this vast, frozen reserve.

“Of course,” Dmitry muttered. “Of course there’s a park and a city.”

Steven groaned.

“We’re gonna die in a park, Lex.”

Dmitry rolled his shoulders and gripped the sled harness tighter.

“Not today.”

And they trudged on.

Dmitry muttered something in Russian.

Steven just grunted.

The sun never really showed; just a dim smear of light overhead. Time passed in *hours of white and grey*.

That night, the tent pitched once more. The gear unpacked. They crawled into their sleeping bags, breathing hard, too tired to speak.

**2 Days Remain**

They woke up the following morning, muscles heavy, hungry… the food rations sucked. Maybe a beer would be nice.

Another day of walking through an endless blizzard, trudging through thick snow.

“Dmitry, we have to leave one of the sleds… I can’t handle carrying all shit shit anymore.”

They sat down on a block of frozen ice, evaluating what gear they really needed for the next couple days, leaving more than half of it in the snow bank. Continuing on with just one toboggan with a much smaller sack, just the tents, some food and a few pairs of dry socks, along with their weapons. 

Another nightfall came. Camp deployed, sleep hit. Then the dreams came.

# Chapter 39 - Dreamscape

**Dreamspace - Somewhere Else Entirely**

Dmitry blinked, slowly. The cold was gone. His fingers no longer ached. His legs no longer throbbed. He was seated upright; in an impossibly sleek, smooth chair that seemed to mold perfectly to his frame. Across the table, Steven sat, also waking up to the same silent confusion, brow furrowed, scanning his surroundings with suspicion.

They were no longer in the tent.

They were in a place of impossible engineering.

The **table** before them was immense; constructed from some radiant composite of stone and metal, shimmering faintly. The air itself tasted of rain, cedar, and something floral.

Across from them sat an alien being of immaculate precision and impossible beauty. Towering. Avian. Eyes like twin galaxies. It had six limbs: two clawed feet, two taloned arms, and two folded wings, tipped in luminescent blue plumage that shimmered. Its robes and armor merged into a tapestry of ceremonial rank, woven with circuitry and iridescent thread. A being of knowledge. 

An Avaris of the planet Kavariin.

To the left of the table sat something very different. Small. Quiet. And coiled in the chair like an observer. It had no mouth, only mirrored eyes and thin, fractal-split limbs, its skin shimmered with faint bio-luminescence. It looked just like… In the rover photographs. On Nhexus. Thirty years ago.

An Oc’Xari.

And then… to the right.

Thick.

Swollen.

Heaving breath that oozed across the table like smoke.

The Pig.

Its flesh was rotted but slick, as if always wet. Blackened eyes sunk so deep they reflected no light at all. Its hooves cracked the surface beneath the table with each twitch. Its lips pulled back into something between a smirk and a snarl.

It was visibly annoyed. Grumbling. Irritated like a monster who had been made to sit through bureaucracy.

Steven whispered.

“What the hell is this…”

Dmitry looked at him, then slowly back at the entities seated with them. His voice was barely a murmur.

“It’s a meeting.”

They had been summoned.

A conference across dimensions, minds, and biology; between four races born from three separate origins: the natural (Avaris from Kavariin), the two artificial LUCA seed-born species - the Oc’Xari and the Humans, and the anomalous Pig.

---

The Avaris had brought with them an elegant device ; smooth and silver pendant hung from an exquisite metal chain casting shimmering tendrils of light. The Oc’Xari’s hung the necklace over its translucent neck.

Through it, the Oc’Xari could speak. Not in vibrations or flashes, but in words ; translated perfectly into the neural rhythms of all present.

The Oc’Xari entity leaned forward, its movements slow, deliberate ; almost reverent.

“I must speak in my defense,” it said calmly, its voice a graceful harmony of tones.


“We are not spyware. We are not vermin. We are a learning species. Our function is observation. Reflection. Understanding.”

“We do not conquer. We do not infect. We do not torment or make deals or experiment or harm. We simply watch ; and we analyze.”

It shifted slightly toward the Pig, though it did not dare look directly into its festering, burning eyes.

“When we arrived on Earth, we did not invade. Dallas Red, was an honorable creature. Curious. Generous. Humble. So we gave him a gift.”


“We did not haunt. We did not curse. We watched him with appreciation. He played music. He shared. He made contact without fear.”

There was a pause. The Avaris diplomat ; regal, towering, radiant ; blinked slowly. Their wide, ancient eyes took in each being around the table. Of all present, the Avaris was the most confused.

For the first time in millennia, the Avaris had proof they were not alone ; and not only that, but late to a galaxy already in chaos. The Avaris world residents had no knowledge of the LUCA seed. No awareness that the Humans and the Oc’Xari were both born of synthetic genesis ; cousins, from the same flawed evolutionary tree.

To them, the Pig was perhaps another species ; grotesque, yes, but still *tangible*. Still *alien*.

They did not yet grasp that it was something older. Beyond species. Beyond *form*.

The Oc’Xari continued, gently.

“The Pig has hunted us since we were stardust. With vengeance it hunted everything born from LUCA.”


“We did not create the LUCA Canon. We were simply born from it. Like the humans. Like all the others. And technically- if you created The Ancient Ones who created us - we are still your creation - just a byproduct of something you created. So we are still natural.”

“We only want to learn.”

And then ;

The table shook.

The lights dimmed ; even though they weren’t lights, but ambient projections of some higher energy. Still, they dimmed.

And the Pig leaned forward, every word snarled from its throat like hot sewage bubbling up through a corpse's lungs.

“I BUILT this universe.”


“I *designed* the worlds. I *painted* the galaxies. I chose every moon, every river, every sunset... and YOU-”

“You littered it. With your crawling, drooling, glitched-out sludge-children!”

Its tusks flared. Its eyes flared. Its skin rippled with the pressure of barely-contained entropy.

“And YOU-” the Pig turned to Dmitry, venom dripping in every syllable.


“You’ve had six days already.”

“WHERE IS THE ARTIFACT?”

Dmitry opened his mouth, but it was Steven who answered ; wiping sweat from his brow, his voice raw, half-apologetic.

“There’s been a blizzard… a bad one. The Coquihalla, Revelstoke, everything east of it ; buried. We’ve been walking for days. Almost there.”

The Pig snapped ; its face contorting into a boiling cauldron of outrage. Its jowls quivered, eyes wide, tongue whipping out like a serpent tasting the lies in the air.

“EXCUSES!” it barked.


“The language of filthy, disgusting, trash-beings who would trade eternal purpose for friendship and pitiful whining!”

The table trembled again. A gust of heat rolled out from the Pig's form ; the dreamspace buckling at the seams.

Steven clenched his jaw.

Dmitry stared, hands on the table, breath caught in his chest.

The Avaris diplomat said nothing yet ; still parsing, still weighing.

And the Oc’Xari… simply watched.

---

The Pig’s breath fogged the air with invisible heat; not warmth, but a radiance of pure hostility. Its tusks curled downward like melted pillars, drool slicking its lower jowls.

Steven tried to sit up straighter, as if that would shield him. Dmitry didn’t blink.

Across the table, the Avaris diplomat finally stirred.

Their feathers shimmered with shifting patterns ; not just colors, but entire *glyphs* ; emotional code baked into light. When they spoke, it was not with a voice but with a resonant hum that vibrated in the bones of those present. The translator embedded in the table rendered it into language.

“I have… listened.”

They looked at the Pig.

“You claim creation. You claim design. You claim… offense.”

Their head tilted.

“If this is your universe, and your rules… then was the flaw not yours?”

The Pig let out a low, guttural growl. The table groaned beneath the pressure of it.

“The LUCA Seed was not mine,” the Pig seethed.

“It was a mutation. A rogue act by failed flesh that believed existence was a gift to be mass-produced.”

“I created ecosystems, timelines, endings. Their meddling ruptured that cycle ; and now you see the result.”

“Nhexus life slop. Serica’s tacky style. Earth’s screaming decay. Ferron… somewhat admirable… Thousands of ruined attempts to imitate the divine.”

The Avaris of Kavariin remained unmoved.

“If they were flawed… could they not be healed?”

The Pig snapped around ; pointing a cloven, steaming hoof at the Oc’Xari.

“HEALED? They’ve multiplied. Infested! Look at it ; pretending to be noble, when all it does is consume knowledge like a virus, hoarding it, waiting.”

The Oc’Xari rippled, then replied with evenness.

“We do not wait to destroy. We wait to understand.”

“We do not spread to conquer. We spread because our biology is adaptive. We change to survive, not to dominate.”

Dmitry muttered under his breath.

“You mean like a cancer.”

The Oc’Xari turned its face ; if it *was* a face ; toward him.

“Only if one assumes the body is sacred, and not evolving.”

That reply seemed to unsettle even the Avaris.

Steven finally snapped ; slapping his hand against the table.

“Everyone keeps talkin’ like we’re cosmic bacteria, like we were some accident. Well hell ; maybe we were! But we still had dreams, families, stories…”

“Haoyu’s son kept a picture of his dad for twelve years. Dallas just wanted peace on his ranch. I just wanted to fish and drink beer. And you -” He pointed at the Pig. “-You crawled into our dreams and ripped all of it apart.”

The Pig's grin curled slowly.

“The suffering of you and your friends would have never happened under my rulership, my lost, deranged child.”

“I intend to correct it.”

Then the Avaris diplomat asked, calmly:

“And what of your correction? You demand the destruction of the Oc’Xari species ; a race born not by choice, but by code. You threaten to erase an entire civilization. Is that creation… or revenge?”

The Pig answered.

“Once the Trojan horse engulfs all that exists, you would not ask questions. All they’d have to do is change slightly, to infect and destroy everything.”

Then, it turned back to Dmitry ; eyes pulsing like dying stars.

“One day.”


“You have one final day to bring me the artifact.”

“If you do not… the sky will scream with fire. And every mistake the universe made will burn with it.”

It leaned in now, massive and hideous ; a grotesque gravity in the shape of wrath.

“I will obliterate my own universe, wipe it completely off the table ; *my* Kavariin world with it, and I will start over from scratch. What a shame it would be.”

And then, with a sound like meat tearing through fog, the Pig ruptured into a cloud ; a swirling, viscous mist of dried pus, filth, and something Dmitry could only describe as the texture of plague. It hovered for a moment in the dream-air like a haunted infection, then evaporated.

Gone.

Silence fell over the chamber.

Dmitry and Steven were left at the table ; still seated, their breath shallow ; alongside the two ancient beings:

- The Oc’Xari: shrouded in its shifting membranes of fluid thought, voice pulsing with tone more than sound.
- The Avaris diplomat: tall and solemn, their radiant feathers dimmed into a twilight gold, wings wrapped like ceremonial robes.

It was the Avaris who spoke first ; and this time, without translation delay. Somehow, the technology embedded into the dream-space now synchronized their languages directly.

“That… entity,” the Avaris began slowly, “wields truths alongside delusion. It is not a god, but it believes it is. And belief; carried long enough; can carve a shape into reality.”

Dmitry, still shaken, managed a hoarse reply.

“But it’s not wrong, is it? The universe is broken. We’ve seen it. We lived it.”

The Oc’Xari pulsed with a softer light.

“And yet ; in the cracks of that brokenness, you built cities. Made art. Sang songs. Loved.”

“What the Pig calls ‘error’… is often evolution.”

Steven spoke up, rubbing his eyes.

“All I wanted was to drink a beer by the beach, maybe play some country music, flirt with a waitress, raise a dog.”

“Instead I got dreams full of rotting pigs and doomsday countdowns.”

The Avaris turned toward them with a look not of pity, but of empathy sharpened by age.

“You are young, still. So young. Your world has barely breathed. But you stand now at a decision tree which no living being has ever faced.”

They stepped forward, talons clicking on the polished dream-stone floor.

“The Pig, for all its horror, is not wrong about it’s logic. Its presence corrodes minds, warps choices, infects timelines ; even mine. It is a rot that sees itself as justice.”

“But it can be stopped.”

“Not with guns. Not with prayers. But with… agreement.”

Dmitry narrowed his eyes.

“What does that mean?”

The Oc’Xari answered.

“It thrives on solitude. On deals made in darkness. When many minds unite, when intention resonates, it fractures. Containment becomes possible.”

The Avaris added for clarity;

“Dmitry, I will grant you a special artifact, when you find the guitar, I want you to place the artifact into the sound hole, it will teleport you and the guitar back here to our world, where you will be safe from the entity. The guitar will be kept in a containment trap cell, where if the Pig comes for it- we can trap the Pig and bind it to the artifact. You may live out the rest of your life on Kavariin, in peace, where we’d form an alliance with the Oc’Xari and the rest of the Human race.”

Dmitry’s thoughts raced. He saw Haoyu, sobbing in his cell. Dallas, rotting in a cage. A planet asleep at the wheel. And a race of feathered sky-beings and curious membrane-folk all now intertwined in his fate.

“So… I have three choices now…” Dmitry murmured.

He held up a finger.

“Option one. I do nothing. Call the Pig’s bluff. Maybe he’s just noise. Maybe he’s a parasite with a god complex and no real power- or he haunts my friends souls for eternity.”

Another finger.

“Option two. I find the artifact. Bring it to the Pig. He ends the Oc’Xari. Rewinds time. Everyone forgets everything. The horror stops, but at the cost of genocide.”

Then the third.

“Option three. I try to stop it. With you. We set a bind trap for the Pig. But Haoyu will die. Steven’s soul will be taken. The Pig will retaliate. I get all the downsides of Option one… The price will be-"

His voice faltered.

The Avaris completed the sentence for him.

“-Unknowable.”

Steven shook his head slowly.

“So that’s it? Time-bombed extinction, cosmic genocide, or fighting the damn devil with a bird and a jellyfish?”

The Oc’Xari rippled gently.

“It is not a fair decision. But I must add - do you truly believe the Pig can turn back time? Do you truly believe the Pig can trap souls and haunt them?”

Dmitry looked down at the table. His reflection shimmered in its surface ; not of a man, but of someone becoming something else.

Then he looked at Steven.

“Well ain’t that another fucking option... Sounds like I die in 2 of them, can’t you throw me a bone here birdman?” said Steven.

Dmitry sighed and asked from dumb curiosity.

“So what’s the plan for Option 3?” 

Steven yelling in the back “HEY! DON’T BE THINKING OF DOING OPTION 3 AND GETTING ME KILLED!”

The Oc’Xari responded “Just as the Avaris mentioned, you will wake up with this artifact, you are to place it in the sound hole of the guitar, and it will teleport you, with the guitar here to Kavariin, where we will safe guard you, the guitar, and form an alliance with Humanity.”

The Avaris pitched in “The pig seems impatient, it’s fair to assume that if you don’t bring him the guitar in one day, he might find someone else to do it… you must hurry.” 

Dmitry then said:

“It’s still a long journey, I need more time.”

The Avaris gave a subtle nod.

“Unfortunately I’m not a God. I cannot extend the deadline… now wake. Your time begins again.”

And the dream dissolved once more into snow, breath, and tent canvas.

# Chapter 40 - Banff

### **I. Yoho**

**1 day till the deadline**

---

Dmitry and Steven woke up in their tent, side by side, stiff and sore but alive. The canvas above them creaked from the residual wind, a low murmur compared to the roaring storms of nights prior.

Steven groaned, rubbing the sleep from his eyes - looking over at Dmitry, who had what looked something like an alien cellphone on his chest - *the Kavariin artifact.*

“You’ve got a tough choice to make, cowboy. If you give the artifact to the Pig, you get to roll back time and save the world from all this bullshit. If you put that artifact inside the other artifact you save an alien civilization and unite them with humanity… but, I’ll be gone, and you’d better have a good reason for my sacrifice.”

Dmitry sat up slowly, blinking into the pale blue morning light. His breath steamed faintly in the air. For a moment, he didn’t answer.

Then, softly:

“Why me?” he said, voice low and hollow. “Why the fuck is this my decision?”

He looked down at his weather-worn hands. Calloused. Trembling.

“I’m not chosen. I’m not holy. I’m just a washed-up engineer. A janitor, for god’s sake. A Russian immigrant with a criminal record now, drawer full of unpaid bills and  broken dreams.”

Steven didn’t respond. He just exhaled and patted Dmitry’s shoulder.

They packed up quietly, their bodies aching as they hoisted the sled once again and resumed their march. The air had changed. There was a crispness, yes; but beneath it, warmth.

About six kilometers from Banff, the first beams of sun pierced the thinning cloud cover. With each kilometer closer, the world seemed to thaw.

Puddles pooled in the edges of the road, rivulets of meltwater streaming through the snowbanks. They unzipped their jackets ; finally ; and rolled up their sleeves.

A few patches of green emerged along the roadside like secrets long buried.

By the time they crossed into the town center of Banff, it didn’t even feel like the same world. Snow still clung to rooftops and hillsides, but the air was gentle, even sweet. A breeze carried the scent of pine and spring runoff.

They stopped near a wide civic park at the edge of the main strip ; kids laughing in the distance, someone strumming a guitar nearby, and the sound of dogs barking joyfully in the snow.

They threw their boots off, peeled their jackets, and collapsed shirtless onto a park bench, backs stretched out like sunbathers in July.

Dmitry tilted his face to the sky.

“Is this heaven?” he muttered. “Or just Canada?”

Steven chuckled.

“You know, after the week we had, I’d believe either.”

They sat like that for a long time, letting the warmth soak into their bones.

Eventually, conversation stirred.

“Remember the drug lord?” Steven said, grinning sideways. “I still got blood under my fingernails.”

“I been thinking about it, I think you might have killed him.” Dmitry muttered, eyes still closed. “I thought we were just borrowing his... firearms.”

“We borrowed everything, right? The guns. The car. The ski gear. The dignity.”

They both laughed.

Then Steven added:

“And let’s not forget the train.”

Dmitry groaned, covering his face.

“The Amtrak heist,” he said. “We were two grown men hiding behind crates of produce like cartoon criminals.”

Steven held up a finger.

“Don’t forget the cop in Revelstoke who thought he was hosting a travel brochure.”

Dmitry mimicked the officer’s voice in perfect sarcasm.

“‘You’ll love it here, folks. Take a look at our steakhouses, craft breweries, and scenic fucking death blizzards.’”

“Then there was the cute barista girl in Golden,” Steven added wistfully. “She thought we were trust fund idiots on a survival challenge retreat.”

Dmitry smirked.

“We are idiots. Just not the trust fund kind.”

They went quiet for a moment. The sun dipped lower, casting long amber shadows on the melting pavement. Children shouted in the background. A bus rumbled lazily by. Somewhere, a bird sang.

“And then the dream,” Dmitry murmured.

Steven’s smile faded. He sat up a little straighter.

“Yeah.”

“That Avaris,” he continued. “Like... a damn statue carved from light.”

“And the Oc’Xari... not even sure how to describe it. But it felt... honest. Like it wasn’t lying. Just... different.”

Dmitry nodded slowly.

“And the Pig...”

They both went quiet again.

“He’s not just evil,” Steven said. “He’s something else. Like rot that thinks it’s doing good.”

“Like mushrooms and flies that eat up the dead to keep the world clean” Dmitry added.

A moment passed.

“So... what are you gonna do?” Steven finally asked.

Dmitry didn’t answer.

He just stared forward, eyes fixed towards a sign pointing towards the highway out of Banff, the long stretch toward the rising prairie, toward the artifact, toward Swift Current... toward whatever waited in the end.

![ChatGPT Image May 11, 2025, 09_00_35 PM.png](Chapter%2040%20-%20Banff/ChatGPT_Image_May_11_2025_09_00_35_PM.png)

### **II. Borrowing things… lots of things…**

Steven leaned back, arms sprawled along the sun-warmed bench, the light glinting off the melted snow pooling around their bare feet.

Dmitry pulled his shirt over his head, still eyeing the highway sign.

“So,” he muttered, brushing sweat from his brow, “how are we going to steal a car in broad daylight?”

Steven sat up, scratched the back of his neck, and grinned that crooked, swamp-boy grin.

“Alright, now hear me out,” he began, slipping effortlessly into full-blown Florida logic.


“Back home, we used to bait gators by tossin’ rotisserie chickens in the lake with fishin’ hooks tied to 'em. Worked every time.”

Dmitry blinked.

“...And what’s that got to do with cars?”

Steven leaned in, lowering his voice like he was hatching the plan of the century.

“You ever seen rich tourists in mountain towns? They all leave their keys in them fancy SUVs when they’re runnin’ in to grab a chai latte or some vegan moose jerky or whatever. We just find one that’s still warm, toss a backpack on the windshield like we’re makin’ a delivery, and when they step out to check it—BAM. One of us jumps in and goes, the other plays dumb and wanders off like a confused hiker.”

Dmitry stared for a beat.

“That’s your plan.”

Steven nodded proudly.

“It’s Banff-proof, baby.”

“...And what if it fails?”

Steven shrugged.

“Then we improvise. Worst case, I start screamin’ in tongues and pretend I’m a Bigfoot that got turned into a man by a cursed glacier. Canadians’ll leave you alone real quick if they think you’re insane.”

Dmitry sighed through a chuckle, rubbing his temples.

“You’re an idiot.”

“A useful idiot,” Steven said, tapping the side of his head. “Now let’s go find us a warm engine and a dumb latte.”

They stood, gathering their gear, sunshine still gleaming off their high-tech jackets, water dripping from their boots ; two half-broken fugitives, heading off to rob a suburban SUV like it was the fate of the galaxy.

Because, somehow, it was.

They scouted for a while.

Banff wasn’t huge; quaint and touristy, stitched together with boutiques, rental shops, and overfunded espresso cafes. It was the kind of town that dressed up its fire hydrants with little scarves in winter.

Which made it *perfect*.

Dmitry and Steven split up across opposite corners of the small shopping district. No one questioned them ; they looked the part of eccentric backcountry hikers, all kitted out in thousand-dollar Archon survival tech. A few tourists even nodded respectfully, mistaking them for some kind of pro Arctic ultramarathoners.

Steven found it first.

A **gleaming silver SUV** - late model, electric hybrid, with solar panels etched into the roof and tires still wet from melted snow. Parked sloppily in front of a trendy restaurant named *The Grizzly House*. The engine was still humming.

Steven peaked at the lunch menu out front on the roadside.

“$80 for Rattlesnake fondue?! I can get a snake in the swamp for free down in Fort Myers!” 
”Blyet, what kind of person spends $20 on a salad…” added Dmitry
”The type of person about to get their nice SUV stolen.” Steven sneered

Inside, a man in a pastel vest and snowboarding goggles on his forehead was fiddling with his phone in line, waiting on expensive meats.

Steven, watching from across the street, whispered into the comm piece he'd found tucked in their gear bag:

“Lex. I got a fish. Big dumb trout. Key's prob’ly still in the dash.”

“You sure?” Dmitry replied, eyes scanning the street from a covered alleyway.

“You ever see a man with ski goggles wearin’ ‘em indoors? That’s not a thinker.”

“Alright. Do it.”

Steven grabbed a delivery backpack they'd kept for exactly this reason ; a faded green bag that looked like it used to deliver pizza in a city three provinces away. He sauntered across the street, casual, limping a bit like his legs were sore from climbing glaciers (they *were*), and dropped the bag square on the SUV’s windshield. He knocked on the hood, pretending to squint at a receipt.

The tourist inside the restaurant took the bait. Confused, then annoyed, he stepped out to yell something like *“I didn’t order anything!”*

At that exact moment - Dmitry moved.

Clean, smooth, controlled.

He slid into the driver’s seat, already wearing gloves, eyes scanning for any anti-theft measures. Found the start pad. Pressed it.

The SUV didn’t complain. It purred.

Steven shrugged, nodded politely to the guy, muttered something about “wrong address” and jogged off down the alley just as Dmitry eased the vehicle into motion.

Steven leapt in at the next intersection, slamming the door shut behind him, both of them bursting into laughter as the mountains rolled by on either side.

“You actually dropped a delivery bag on the hood,” Dmitry said, steering onto the ice-slick highway.

“Told ya. Rich folks see logos and immediately assume reality.”

“And if he called the cops?”

“Then they’ll be lookin’ for two wilderness rescue rangers from Nova Scotia deliverin’ vegan rotisserie chickens. We’re ghosts, baby.”

They merged onto the Trans-Canada Highway, heading east. Banff faded behind them. The peaks glistened like frozen teeth in the rearview mirror.

Ahead ; open road. Clear skies.

# Chapter 42 - Option 1

### **I. Another Round in Saskatchewan**

**Swift Current, Saskatchewan - 11:47 PM**

After a nonstop one-shot drive across the stretching Canadian prairie, mostly taking the smaller lesser known highways to try and evade police looking for the stolen vehicle along the Trans-Canada Highway. Dmitry and Steven finally rolled into the outskirts of Swift Current under a dim, frost-bitten sky. The journey had been long ; mostly silent ; with only occasional bursts of conversation to break the tension. Neither man had much left to say. Their thoughts ran in circles, spiraling around the same three possibilities: deliver the artifact, defy the Pig, or gamble on something even riskier.

They’d stopped twice for gas, once for snacks ; each time brief, silent, mechanical. The roads had been clear, eerie in their emptiness, the highways ghostlike beneath the dim shimmer of the slowly rising moon.

By the time they reached the heart of the town, it was nearing midnight. The place looked dead. Frozen. The sidewalks were glazed in layers of old ice, the roads half-lit by flickering yellow lamps. Everything had that abandoned feel ; as if even time had forgotten Swift Current.

# **The Variation**

“You know- I’ve been thinking.” Dmitry finally spoke after a long ride of thought.

“The Pig said, he can’t interact with physical objects that were made by things he didn’t create. The Pig can’t manipulate things physically, he doesn’t really have that much control. I don’t think he can turn back time either. If he had all this power, he could go get the guitar himself.”

Steven thought, and replied “Yeah, I thought about this several times throughout our trek… he also was getting impatient at the meeting table. Like if he wanted to get this all done asap, he would have found another way to do it… Dallas’s barn is like a fucking spawn point for demons.”

“-And the guitar is a link or a tuning mechanism for said spawn point”- added Dmitry.

As they pulled up to the police station, they looked inside and saw a dim light, just a lone police officer watching a tv show… looked like he was sleeping.

“What the police station is also tainted by harboring the artifact?” Steven wondered out loud.

Dmitry pulled off to a side street, as they watched the police station from afar. Then he added- “I don’t really trust the pig, but I don’t trust the Oc’Xari either. And the Avaris seemed like it just randomly got thrown into all of this as a last ditch effort, they are probably just as clueless as us.”

“I’m gonna give you another option Dmitry.” Steven taunted goofily trying to imitate the voice of the pig. They both laughed a bit over it… then Steven continued “If the Pig is serious, I’m gonna die, but I somehow think he’s full of shit. My option to you is - we go to the nearest gas station, fill up a few jerry cans - we come back to the police station, burn it down, and we go to the barn and we burn it down. Burn all the links that were opened to other worlds.”

“The police officer will extinguish the fire…” argued Dmitry.

Steven pulled his glock out checking the ammo - Dmity annoyingly added “ **tsssk** we are not going to kill the cop.”

“Dmitry I’m serious - this might even be a better idea - we kill the cop, we enter and burn the guitar, we burn the other artifact they gave you - then we go to Dallas’ Ranch and we burn that down too, and we escape to Northern Canada through the ice storms.”

Silence passed, just the sound of the soft, luxury engine humming of the SUV, and wind howling outside.

Without a word, Dmitry started driving down the street, until they reached a gas station. 

Dmitry went into the store to take a look around - he found a few oil filters, bought one.

They picked out a few jerry cans, filled them up with gasoline and placed them in the trunk of the SUV beside a nice big wrench… Dmitry grabbed the wrench and brought it with him to the front seat.
Then headed back to the police station.

**The Plan**

He pulled out a folded napkin and drew a crude layout of the station, based on their drive-by recon.

“There’s a back door here,” he pointed. “Likely leads to a small hallway. Locker room, bathroom, maybe holding cell. If the artifact’s locked up anywhere, it’s either in evidence… or the armory.”

“Or,” Steven added, “sittin’ on some dumbass desk ‘cause the guy inside thinks it’s just some busted alien banjo.”

Dmitry continued.

“I’ll go around back. Quietly. You go through the front. Start knocking, draw his attention ; talk to him, pretend you need help or something.”

“Then what?”

“Then I’ll sneak in, and I will beat him over the head with this wrench. We zip-tie him, gag him. Non-lethal if possible.”

Steven raised an eyebrow.

“Like how I non-lethally killed the drug dealer back in Seattle?”

Dmitry shrugged.

“Yeah like that - if it doesn’t work, we can shoot him - but that is only worst case scenario.”

“Got it, I’ll shoot down the snow bear if the plan goes south.”

Dmitry passed him the oil filter he bought from the gas station.

>"When you shoot... put your glock barrel through it, it won't silence the shot, but, it'll at least make it a bit quieter.  
>“Once he’s down, maybe thirty minutes before anyone even thinks to check in. We find the evidence locker. Grab the guitar artifact. Then we get out. Fast, and we can burn it in a field.”

Steven took a long breath. Then double checked under his jacket ensuring the Glock and magazines were secured, slipped the oil filter in his other pocket, and nodded.

“Alright. Let’s rob ourselves a police station.”

### **II. The Assault**

**The Break-In was underway**

They headed to their positions.

Steven walked up to the front door of the police station, his breath visible in the freezing air. He knocked ; loud, insistent, the kind of knock that said *I need help*.

Inside, the officer stirred. A middle-aged man, balding, with a gut that suggested too many donuts and not enough exercise. He looked annoyed as he shuffled to the door.

The officer cracked it open, suspicious.

"Yeah? What do you want?"

Steven put on his best distressed face.

"Oh thank God, officer! My truck broke down about two miles back, and my phone's dead. I've been walkin' in this cold for like an hour. Can I use your phone? Just need to call a tow truck."

The officer looked him up and down, clearly skeptical.

"Miles? Where's your truck?"

"Back on Highway 1, near the turnoff. Engine just died on me. I think it's the alternator."

The officer sighed, clearly not wanting to deal with this.

"Alright, come in. But make it quick."

He opened the door wider, and Steven stepped inside, stomping his boots to shake off the snow.

The station was small ; just a front desk, a couple of chairs, a TV playing some late-night rerun, and a hallway leading to the back.

The officer gestured to the phone on the desk.

"There. Make your call."

Steven picked up the phone, pretending to dial, while keeping the officer talking.

"Man, I appreciate this. You know, I'm from Florida originally. Never thought I'd end up freezin' my ass off in Saskatchewan."

The officer grunted, half-listening.

"Florida, huh? Long way from home."

"Yeah, man. You ever been? It's wild down there. I got stories for days. Like this one time, my cousin and I were fishin' in the Everglades, right? And this gator ; I'm talkin' a big one, like twelve feet ; just comes outta nowhere and tries to snatch the fish right off my line."

The officer raised an eyebrow, slightly more interested now.

"What'd you do?"

"What'd I do? I grabbed the nearest thing I could find ; a beer bottle ; and I chucked it at the gator's head. Bounced right off. Didn't even faze him. But it distracted him long enough for me to reel in the fish and get the hell outta there."

The officer chuckled.

"You're full of shit."

"I swear on my mama's grave, man. Florida's a different world. You got gators, you got meth heads, you got hurricanes. One time, my neighbor ; this old dude named Earl ; he got so high on bath salts he tried to fight a palm tree. Thought it was a demon or somethin'."

The officer laughed, shaking his head.

"Jesus Christ, alright are you gonna call this tow truck?"

Steven kept going, spinning more ridiculous stories, keeping the officer distracted.

Meanwhile, Dmitry crept around the back of the station. The back door was locked, but it was old ; a simple deadbolt. He pulled out a small pry bar from his jacket and worked it into the frame.

*Click.*

The door opened.

He slipped inside, moving silently down the hallway. He could hear Steven's voice from the front, still rambling about Florida.

Dmitry reached the corner, peeking around.

The officer had his back to him, leaning against the desk, laughing at one of Steven's stories.

Perfect.

Dmitry gripped the wrench, took a breath, and stepped forward.

But then ; the officer turned.

Their eyes met.

"What the—"

The officer's hand went for his gun.

Steven reacted instantly. He dropped the phone, pulled the Glock from his jacket, fumbled the oil filter over his barrel, and fired.

*BANG.*

The shot echoed through the small station like a thunderclap... but, muffled from outside at least.

The officer's head snapped back, a spray of blood hitting the wall behind him. His body crumpled to the floor, lifeless.

Silence.

Steven stood there, gun still raised, breathing hard.

Dmitry stared at the body, then at Steven.

"Fuck."

"He saw you. He was gonna shoot."

"I know. I know."

They stood there for a moment, the weight of what just happened settling over them.

Then Dmitry shook his head, snapping back to focus.

"We need to move. Now."

They ran down the hallway, searching for the evidence locker.

It didn't take long. A small room, locked with a keypad.

Dmitry cracked it in less than a minute.

Inside: rows of shelves, boxes, sealed bags. And there, in the corner ; the guitar case. Black. Old. Humming faintly.

Steven grabbed it.

"Got it. Let's go."

"Wait."

Dmitry pulled out the jerry cans from the SUV, which they'd brought in through the back door.

He started pouring gasoline ; on the floor, on the walls, on the desk, on the officer's body.

The smell was overwhelming.

Steven watched, then nodded.

"Burn it all."

Dmitry pulled out a lighter, flicked it open, and tossed it onto the gasoline-soaked floor.

*WHOOSH.*

The flames erupted instantly, spreading fast, consuming everything.

They ran.

Out the back door, into the freezing night, the fire roaring behind them.

They threw the guitar case into the SUV and sped off, tires screeching on the icy road.

Behind them, the police station slowly burned... by the time the neighborhood noticed, they were gone.

---

### **III. The Field**

They drove for twenty minutes, heading out into the open prairie. No lights. No houses. Just endless snow and darkness.

Finally, Dmitry pulled off the road into a field, the SUV's headlights cutting through the night.

They got out, dragging the guitar case with them.

Steven opened it.

The guitar gleamed in the headlights, its strings humming with that same eerie frequency. The sound hole was dark, impossibly deep.

Dmitry stared at it.

"This thing… it's a doorway. A link. The Pig said it himself."

"Then we close it."

Steven poured gasoline over the guitar, soaking it completely.

Dmitry pulled out the Avaris artifact from his jacket ; still pulsing faintly.

"And this?"

"Burn it too."

He placed it on top of the guitar.

Steven flicked the lighter.

"You sure about this?"

Dmitry nodded.

"Burn it all."

Steven dropped the lighter.

The flames erupted, consuming the guitar and the artifact in a roaring inferno.

The sound was… wrong.

Not the crackling of wood and metal burning, but something else. A high-pitched wail, like the universe itself was screaming.

The flames turned blue, then white, then something beyond color.

Dmitry and Steven stumbled back, shielding their eyes.

And then ; silence.

The fire died.

All that remained was ash.

Steven kicked at the remains.

"It's done."

Dmitry looked at the sky, half-expecting the Pig to appear, to rage, to punish them.

But nothing happened.

Just the wind. The cold. The endless prairie.

---

### **IV. The Barn**

They drove through the night, heading back toward Dallas's ranch.

The barn loomed in the distance, dark and silent.

They parked the SUV a safe distance away and approached on foot, carrying the remaining jerry cans.

The barn looked the same as it had before ; old, weathered, but somehow… wrong. The air around it felt thick, oppressive.

Steven kicked the door open.

Inside, the barn was empty. No animals. No equipment. Just dust and shadows.

But the feeling was undeniable. This place was tainted.

Dmitry poured gasoline everywhere ; on the walls, on the floor, on the beams.

Steven did the same.

When they were done, they stood outside, looking at the barn one last time.

"Dallas would've wanted this."

"Yeah."

Steven lit a rag, tossed it through the door.

The barn exploded into flames.

They didn't watch, they ran to the SUV, and drove quickly away from the crime scene.

---

### **V. The Escape**

They drove north. Fast.

The plan was simple: get as far from civilization as possible, disappear into the Canadian wilderness, and hope the authorities couldn't track them.

But they knew it wouldn't be that easy.

They'd killed a cop. Burned down a police station and a barn. Destroyed evidence. Not to mention all the stuff they "borrowed".

Every law enforcement agency in North America would be looking for them.

They were running low on fuel, but didn't want to stop at any gas stations in risk of being seen by cameras or witnesses.

They ditched the SUV in a ravine, covering it with snow and branches.

Then they walked.

For days.

Through blizzards. Through forests. Through frozen rivers.

They rationed what little food they had. Slept in caves. Avoided roads.

Dmitry's engineering knowledge kept them alive ; he built fires, fashioned tools, navigated by the stars.

Steven's survival instincts kept them moving ; he knew how to hunt, how to track, how to stay hidden.

But they were running out of time.

On the fifth day, they stumbled into a small town ; barely more than a gas station and a few houses.

They needed supplies. Food. Warmth.
The sign read "Welcome to Spiritwood, Saskatchewan."
Steven commented;
"The Spirits are with us."

They crept into the gas station, hoping to steal what they needed and disappear.

But as they were loading up, a man approached them.

Middle-aged. Dark skin. Well-dressed, despite the cold.

He looked at Dmitry, then at Steven.

And then he smiled.

"Dmitry Alexeyev."

Dmitry froze.

"How do you—"

"I know who you are. I know what you've done. And I know what you know."

Steven's hand went to his gun.

The man raised his hands.

"Relax. I'm not here to turn you in. I'm here to offer you a way out."

"Who are you?"

"My name is Bihiniwa Okonkwo. I represent the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And we've been watching you."

Dmitry and Steven exchanged a glance.

"Watching us?"

"The incident in Seattle. The escape from the blacksite. The theft of classified materials. The destruction of the police station. You've been making quite a bit of noise, Mr. Alexeyev. You're all over the news."

"What do you want?"

Bihiniwa stepped closer, his voice low.

"You have information. Information about the American government. About extraterrestrial life. About technologies and secrets that have been hidden from the world."

"And?"

"And we want it. In exchange, we offer you sanctuary. Protection. A new life."

Steven scoffed.

"You want us to defect to the Congo?"

"Not just the Congo. We have allies. Yemen. Iraq. Nations that have been marginalized, exploited, kept in the dark by the West. But with your knowledge… we can change that."

Dmitry stared at him.

"You want to use us."

"We want to level the playing field. The West has hoarded power for too long. It's time for a new order."

Silence.

Dmitry looked at Steven.

Steven shrugged.

"We're dead men walking anyway. Might as well make it count."

Dmitry turned back to Bihiniwa.

"What's the plan?"

Bihiniwa smiled.

"We have a plane waiting. We should leave tonight, law enforcement will find you. We found you easily with a drone after we saw you burn down the police station on the news, so it's only a matter of time before they find you as well."

---

### **VI. The Flight South**

The private jet lifted off from a remote airstrip just outside Prince Albert at 3:47 AM.

No customs. No questions. Just a sleek Gulfstream with Congolese diplomatic markings and a crew that spoke French and Lingala.

Dmitry and Steven sat in leather seats that reclined almost flat, staring out the window as the frozen Canadian prairies disappeared beneath them.

Steven leaned back, exhaling slowly.

"This is the nicest thing I've sat in since… ever. The SUV was nice too, don't get me wrong... but... I'm still alive! The Pig didn't kill me!"

Dmitry nodded, still processing.

"I can't believe we're actually doing this."

"Believe it, cowboy. We're defectors now. Traitors to the red, white, and blue."
Steven smirked.

The flight attendant brought them food. Real food. Not gas station jerky or canned chili. Grilled chicken, rice, vegetables, fresh bread.

Steven ate like a man who hadn't seen a proper meal in years.

Dmitry picked at his plate, his mind still racing.

"You think they'll actually protect us?"

"The Congolese? Yeah. They need us. We're their golden ticket to exposing the West's bullshit."

"And if the Americans come for us?"

Steven shrugged.

"Then we die in a nicer place than Saskatchewan."

Dmitry laughed despite himself.

The flight took nearly twenty hours, with a refueling stop in Algeria.
The pilot spoke;
>"Please do not leave the plane, we will depart again within an hour."

Steven and Dmitry looked at the desert outside the window for some time, before the plane lifted off again.
By the time they descended into Kinshasa, the landscape had transformed.

Gone were the frozen plains and snow-covered forests.

Below them: lush green jungle, winding rivers, sprawling urban sprawl.

The air was thick and humid when they stepped off the plane.

Steven pulled off his jacket immediately.

"Now *this* is what I'm talkin' about. No more freezing my ass off."

Dmitry felt the warmth on his skin, the weight of the tropical air.

It was strange. Alien, almost. 
"Feels like we are on another dream planet again!"
Dmitry exclamined.

>"We're on planet CONGO BABY!"
Steven excitedly guffawed.

They were driven to a compound on the outskirts of the city. High walls. Armed guards. But inside, it was almost luxurious.

A two-story house with ceiling fans, mosquito nets, a small courtyard with fruit trees, big fountain with a pool. 

Steven walked through the rooms, grinning.

"Dmitry. We got a *house*. An actual house. With beds. And a kitchen. And a bathroom that doesn't smell like a truck stop."

Dmitry stood on the balcony, looking out at the city lights in the distance.

For the first time in years, he felt something close to peace.

"Yeah," he said quietly. "We do."

That night, they sat on the porch, drinking cold beer, eating grapes off a gold platter provided by their hosts.

The air was alive with the sound of insects, distant music, the hum of the city.

Steven leaned back in his chair, feet up on the railing.

"You know what? I could get used to this."

Dmitry smiled.

"Don't get too comfortable. We still have work to do."

"Yeah, yeah. Save the world, expose the conspiracy, all that. But for tonight? I'm just gonna enjoy not being hunted."

Dmitry raised his bottle.

"To not being hunted."

Steven clinked his bottle against Dmitry's.

"To not being hunted."

They sat in silence for a while, watching the stars.

Different stars than the ones they'd seen in Canada.

But stars nonetheless.

---

Eventually, they went inside.

They entered the common area, grand, fireplace, fountain, beautiful staircase, tapestries and furniture from around the world.
A TV was on in the corner, playing the news.

Dmitry was about to turn it off when he froze.

The anchor's voice was somber.

"…breaking news tonight. The United States government has confirmed the execution of former NASA Commander Haoyu Zhang, who was convicted of treason, espionage, and conspiracy to incite mass hysteria following the Echofall incident…"

The screen showed a photo of Haoyu. Younger. In his NASA uniform. Smiling.

"…Zhang was executed by lethal injection at 11:47 PM Eastern Time. His final words were not disclosed to the public…"

Steven stood beside Dmitry, staring at the screen.

"…the government maintains that Zhang's claims of extraterrestrial contact were fabricated, and that his actions endangered national security…"

Dmitry's jaw tightened.

Steven's fists clenched.

The anchor continued.

"…Zhang's family could not be reached for comment…"

Dmitry turned off the TV.

The room fell silent.

"They killed him."

"Yeah."

Haoyu was gone.

But his fight wasn't over.

---

### **VII. The Defection**

**Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo - Two Weeks Later**

Dmitry and Steven sat in a secure compound, surrounded by armed guards and government officials.

They'd been debriefed for days. Every detail. Every secret. Every piece of classified information they knew.

The Americans. The Russians. The Chinese. The extraterrestrials. The LUCA seed. The Pig. The Oc'Xari. The Avaris.

Everything.

Bihiniwa sat across from them, taking notes.

"This is… extraordinary. If even half of what you're saying is true, it changes everything."

"It's all true," Dmitry said flatly.

"And you destroyed the artifacts? Both of them?"

"Burned them. Along with the barn."

Bihiniwa leaned back, thinking.

"The Americans will deny everything, of course. But with your testimony, with the evidence you've provided… we can expose them."

"And then what?" Steven asked.

"And then the world changes."

---

**Three Months Later**

Dmitry sat in a newly constructed laboratory in Kinshasa, surrounded by Congolese engineers and scientists.

On the screens in front of him: lines of code. Schematics. Signal protocols.

He'd been working nonstop, rebuilding everything from memory.

The software he'd designed for the Echofall mission. The communication arrays. The deep-space relay systems.

And most importantly: the connection to EON-7b.

The rover was still out there, on Nhexus, dormant but functional.

NASA had abandoned it. Declared the mission a failure. Moved on.

But Dmitry hadn't forgotten.

He typed the final command, his fingers trembling slightly.

"This should do it."

One of the Congolese engineers, a woman named Amani, leaned over his shoulder.

"You're sure this will work?"

"If the rover's still operational, yes. We're bypassing NASA's relay entirely. Direct connection through our own satellite network."

He hit enter.

The room fell silent.

For a moment, nothing.

Then—

A ping.

A signal.

**EON-7b ONLINE**

**STATUS: OPERATIONAL**

**LOCATION: NHEXUS SURFACE - SECTOR 7-GAMMA**

The room erupted in cheers.

Dmitry stared at the screen, tears welling in his eyes.

"We did it. We're back."

Steven, watching from the doorway, grinned.

"You beautiful bastard. You actually did it."

Bihiniwa entered the room, flanked by government officials.

"Mr. Alexeyev. This is… extraordinary. You've just given us access to technology and data that NASA has been hiding for years."

Dmitry turned to him.

"This is just the beginning. With the blueprints I've provided—propulsion systems, life support, communication arrays—you can build your own missions. Your own rovers. Your own spacecraft."

"And you'll help us?"

Dmitry nodded.

"On one condition. You take care of Steven and I. And… there's someone else."

Bihiniwa raised an eyebrow.

"Who?"

"Haoyu Zhang. He was the commander that led the Echofall mission. The American government executed him. We couldn't save him."

Bihiniwa looked at Dmitry, then Steven.
"Ah yes, Haoyu Zhang. The one who was executed for treason. He was all over the news worldwide. I remember him. A brave man."

Dmitry paused, his voice heavy.

"His family… I haven't seen or heard from them since prison. A wife. A son. A daughter. They were torn apart after the raid—separated, scattered. I don't know where they are now."

His voice cracked.

"Get an agent to find them. Track them down, wherever they are. All three of them. Fly them here. Get them a house. A good school for the kids. Good jobs. Reunite them."

"He gave his life for this. For what we're doing. His family deserves better than what they have."

Bihiniwa was quiet for a moment, then nodded slowly.

"We'll bring them here. They'll be safe. They'll be taken care of."

"You have my word."

Dmitry extended his hand.

They shook.

And in that moment, the balance of space exploration shifted.

The Congo was no longer a bystander.

They were the frontline.

---

**Six Weeks Later**

It had taken Bihiniwa's agents three weeks to track them down.

The wife was found in Albany, New York—alone, barely surviving in a cramped apartment.

The son was located in Los Angeles, living four stories underground in a shoebox apartment, working for a defense AI firm.

The daughter was the hardest to extract—living with an abusive basketball player in St. Louis. The agents had to intervene carefully, but she came willingly once she understood.

Now, a small plane touched down at Kinshasa International Airport.

Three passengers stepped off, looking exhausted, confused, and cautiously hopeful.

Haoyu's wife, still wearing that same cardigan.

His son, clutching a backpack with an anime keychain.

His daughter, no longer in glittery heels, but in simple jeans and a hoodie.

They were met by Congolese agents in crisp suits who escorted them through customs without a single question.

No interrogations. No paperwork. No delays.

They were treated like VIPs.

Outside, a black luxury SUV waited, air-conditioned and pristine.

And standing beside it: Dmitry.

The wife saw him first. Her eyes widened.

"You… you're the one from the ranch. The Russian."

Dmitry nodded.

"Dmitry Alexeyev. I worked with your husband."

Her voice trembled.

"He's… gone..."

"He's gone. I'm sorry. We did everything we could."

She closed her eyes, tears streaming down her face.

The son stepped forward, his jaw tight.

"Why are we here?"

Dmitry looked at him.

"Because Haoyu was my friend. And he died trying to do the right thing. The least I can do is make sure his family is taken care of."

---

They were taken to a mansion right beside Dmitry and Steven's.
The same gated compound.

A sprawling three-story estate nestled among towering palms and tropical vegetation. Marble floors. Mahogany wood accents. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Congo River in the distance.

Six bedrooms with silk sheets and hand-carved furniture. A chef's kitchen with modern appliances. A private garden with exotic flowers, mango trees, and a crystal-clear infinity pool that seemed to blend into the jungle canopy.

The air was thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine.

Birds called from the trees. Monkeys chattered in the distance.

It was paradise.

Luxury beyond anything they'd ever imagined.

The wife walked through the rooms, her fingers trailing along the mahogany furniture, the silk curtains, the marble countertops.

She stopped in the master bedroom, staring at the king-sized bed with its embroidered linens.

Tears streamed down her face.

The son wandered to the pool, watching the water shimmer in the afternoon light.

The daughter stood on the balcony, looking out at the jungle canopy and the river beyond.

For the first time in years, she felt safe.

Dmitry stood in the doorway.

"The government will provide for you. The best schools in Kinshasa for the kids. A position at the university for you, if you want it. Or just… time. To heal."

"You'll have staff. A chef. Security. Whatever you need."

"And we're right next door. If you need anything."

The wife turned to him, her voice barely a whisper.

"Why? Why all this?"

"Because Haoyu deserved better. And so do you."

She broke down, sobbing.

The son came in from the pool, his eyes red.

The daughter joined them from the balcony.

They held each other, crying—not just from grief, but from relief.

Dmitry quietly stepped outside, giving them space.

Steven was waiting on the shared courtyard path between the two mansions, smoking a cigarette under a mango tree.

"They gonna be okay?"

Dmitry nodded.

"Eventually."

"You did good, cowboy."

Dmitry looked back at the house.

"It's what Haoyu would have wanted."

### **VII. The Revelation**

**Year 1 - The Leak**

The Congolese government, along with allies in Yemen, Iraq, and several other nations, released the information to the world.

Not all at once. Strategically. Carefully.

First, the existence of extraterrestrial life.

Then, the cover-ups by Western governments.

Then, the technologies that had been hidden.

And then—the bombshell.

Live footage from EON-7b on Nhexus.

The rover, now under Congolese control, transmitted images that NASA had suppressed for years.

The fossilized flesh pyramids. The geometric gemstone structures. The evidence of the Oc'Xari civilization that the other network relay drones detected, and never released.

They re-created sensor technology to pickup the signal of the Oc'Xari presence still on Earth till this day, leaking that data again to the public.

The world erupted.

Protests. Riots. Governments toppled.

The United States denied everything, but the evidence was overwhelming.

Dmitry and Steven's testimony. Leaked documents. Satellite footage. And now, real-time data from a rover on an alien world.

The truth could no longer be hidden.

---

**Year 3 - The Space Race Reborn**

The Congo launched its first independent space mission.

Not with American rockets. Not with Russian technology.

With their own.

Built from Dmitry's blueprints. Funded by their mineral wealth. Crewed by Congolese astronauts.

But they didn't do it alone.

The Congo formed the **African Space Alliance**—a coalition with Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia.

Each nation contributed resources, expertise, and personnel.

Rwanda provided advanced computing infrastructure. Kenya offered launch facilities near the equator. Botswana and Tanzania contributed rare earth minerals. Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia provided funding and engineering talent.

Together, they were unstoppable.

The **Lumumba-1** mission reached Mars in record time, establishing the first African research station on another planet.

The mission patch bore the flags of the allied nations, including their supporters from the Middle East.

NASA scrambled to respond, but they were years behind.

The Congo had the data. The technology. The momentum.

And now, they had allies.

Yemen and Iraq followed suit, launching their own missions to the Moon and beyond.

The West, once the undisputed leader in space exploration, was now barely competing.

---

**Year 5 - The Shift**

The balance of power began to shift.

Nations that had been marginalized for decades suddenly had leverage.

The Congo, with its vast mineral wealth and newfound knowledge, became the technological hub of the world.

Their space agency—**ACSA** (African Consortium for Space Advancement)—surpassed NASA in funding, missions, and discoveries.

EON-7b continued its mission on Nhexus, now sending back gigabytes of data daily.

New rovers were deployed. New planets explored.

The Congo became the frontline of humanity's expansion into the cosmos.

Hungary, Algeria, Tajikistan and Bangladesh, once war-torn and exploited, began trade with the Congo and began to rebuild with advanced technologies reverse-engineered from the leaked information.

The West scrambled to maintain control, but it was too late.

The world had changed.

---

**Year 10 - The New Order**

A new global alliance formed ; the **Coalition of the Congo**.

Led by the Congo and its African Space Alliance partners.

Together, they demanded transparency, equality, and an end to Western hegemony.

The United Nations was restructured. Power was redistributed.

Security Council seats were added for the Coalition.

For the first time in centuries, the West was no longer in control.

And in space, the flags of the Coalition flew on Mars, the Moon, and soon—Titan.

Not just the Congo's flag. But many others.

Dmitry and Steven watched from the shadows, living under assumed names in their jungle mansion in Kinshasa.

They were heroes to some. Traitors to others.

But they lived well.

Not far from them, in the mansion next door, Haoyu's family had built a new life.

His son worked as a lead engineer for ACSA, helping design the next generation of rovers. He drove a luxury car and lived in comfort his father never knew.

His daughter graduated top of her class from the University of Kinshasa, studying xenobiology. She was engaged to a Congolese diplomat's son.

His wife ran a well-funded community center, helping other displaced families find their footing. She wore fine clothes now, ate well, and smiled more often.

The Congolese government treated them like royalty—honored guests who represented the sacrifice that changed the world.

They never forgot Commander Haoyu Zhang. They built a monument to him in the city center.

---

**Year 50 - The Legacy**

Dmitry died at the age of 82, peacefully, in his sleep.

Steven outlived him by three years, dying at 85 from complications related to a lifetime of hard living.

They were buried side by side in Kinshasa, their graves constructed with ornate decorated stones. Schools would bring children to pay their respects, to learn what these men have done for their country.

The Coalition of the Congo continued to grow, reshaping global politics for generations.

The entire African continent, united with many allies from Eastern Europe and Asia.

The Coalition became the dominant geopolitical force on Earth.

And the story of Dmitry and Steven ; the janitor and the redneck who burned the gates to other worlds ; became legend.

---

**Year 100 - The Expansion**

Humanity continued to search the stars.

Led by the Coalition's ACSA, humanity had established permanent colonies on Mars, Europa, and Titan.

Research stations operated by Rwandan scientists. Mining operations funded by Botswana, Bulgaria and Namibia. Engineering teams from Bangladesh, Hungary and Iraq.

EON-7b, still operational on Nhexus, had been joined by dozens of other rovers and probes exploring distant worlds.

---

### **Epilogue - The Unanswered Question**

**Year 1000 - The Silence Continues**

Every country on Earth was now a member of the Coalition.

EON-7b, incredibly, was still transmitting from Nhexus after a millennium of operation—a testament to Dmitry's engineering.

Humanity had spread across the solar system. Mars. Europa. Titan. Enceladus. Ganymede.

Humanity did what they have always done - civil wars, political unrest, and all the bullshit of old times started resurfacing again, things were back to normal.
Only now - across many planets.

And that, perhaps, was enough.

**THE END**

# Chapter 43 - Option 2

### **I. Another Round in Saskatchewan**

**Swift Current, Saskatchewan - 11:47 PM**

After a nonstop one-shot drive across the stretching Canadian prairie, mostly taking the smaller lesser known highways to try and evade police looking for the stolen vehicle along the Trans-Canada Highway. Dmitry and Steven finally rolled into the outskirts of Swift Current under a dim, frost-bitten sky. The journey had been long ; mostly silent ; with only occasional bursts of conversation to break the tension. Neither man had much left to say. Their thoughts ran in circles, spiraling around the same three possibilities: deliver the artifact, defy the Pig, or gamble on something even riskier.

They’d stopped twice for gas, once for snacks ; each time brief, silent, mechanical. The roads had been clear, eerie in their emptiness, the highways ghostlike beneath the dim shimmer of the slowly rising moon.

By the time they reached the heart of the town, it was nearing midnight. The place looked dead. Frozen. The sidewalks were glazed in layers of old ice, the roads half-lit by flickering yellow lamps. Everything had that abandoned feel ; as if even time had forgotten Swift Current.

# **The Variation**

They crept past the police station ; just a squat, concrete building wedged between a dental office and a run-down sandwich shop. Only a single cruiser sat out front, rimmed in frost, clearly untouched for hours.

From the dark of their stolen SUV, Steven leaned forward, peering through the windshield.

“I see one guy inside. He’s on the couch… I think he’s sleepin’. Watchin’ some shitty TV show.”

Dmitry nodded grimly, eyes locked on the dim blue flicker coming from the window.

They parked the SUV in the shadows a block away, just beyond the reach of any cameras or street lights.

Inside, they laid their weapons out on the dashboard:

- **The serrated combat knife**, dulled with age but still deadly.
- **The black semi-auto Glock-19**, with two mags Steven tucked into his jacket.
- And the homemade **Mac-10**, now polished, locked, loaded, and ready ; magazine full, bolt open, round chambered, the gun doesn’t even have a safety.

They sat in silence.

The moment felt **heavy**.
The clock of life and death for the universe was ticking.

The cold pressed against the windows. The clock on the dashboard ticked. Somewhere down the road, a dog barked once, then fell silent again.

Dmitry finally broke the silence.

“Alright. Here's how we do it.”

![u8296664269_police_station_night_time_winter_--v_6.1_61c7ae1b-d56c-4325-acc1-4bf937d11ffc_1.png](Chapter%2043%20-%20Option%202/u8296664269_police_station_night_time_winter_--v_6.1_61c7ae1b-d56c-4325-acc1-4bf937d11ffc_1.png)

---

**The Plan**

He pulled out a folded napkin from the gas station and drew a crude layout of the station, based on their drive-by recon.

“There’s a back door here,” he pointed. “Likely leads to a small hallway. Locker room, bathroom, maybe holding cell. If the artifact’s locked up anywhere, it’s either in evidence… or the armory.”

“Or,” Steven added, “sittin’ on some dumbass desk ‘cause the guy inside thinks it’s just some busted alien banjo.”

Dmitry continued.

“You go around back. Quietly. Wait for me to go in through the front. I’ll draw his attention ; talk my way in, maybe pretend I need help.”

“Then what?”

“Then you sneak in, take him down quietly from behind. We zip-tie him, gag him. Non-lethal if possible.”

Steven raised an eyebrow.

“You want me to do the sneak attack? I’m the loud one, remember?”

Dmitry shrugged.

“Yeah, but you’re also the one with experience sneaking out of your cousin’s trailer during meth raids.”

“Got it, I’ll wrestle down the meth ‘gator.”

“Once he’s down, maybe thirty minutes before anyone even thinks to check in. We find the evidence locker. Grab the guitar artifact. Then we get out. Fast.”

Steven took a long breath. Then double checked under his jacket ensuring the Glock and magazines were secured, and nodded.

“Alright. Let’s rob ourselves a police station.”

Dmitry looked at him, flat-eyed, stuffing the Mac 10 into his waistband.

“No killing. Unless it’s him or us.”

“Got it.”

They opened the doors and stepped into the freezing night.

The wind had picked up. Their breath curled out in steam.

The town slept, quiet as a corpse.

And the clock was ticking.

### **II. The Assault**

**The Break-In was underway**

They were heading to their planned positions - Steven to the back, Dmitry to the front… When unexpectedly came across a side entrance with a much easier entry. Quickly they changed their plans. 

Dmitry tapping Steven, with confusing hand signals - with Steven in disarray as he’s trying to communicate with an alien from outer space before Dmitry *tssk* his tongue and whispers

“This side door is a lot more secluded and should be easier to get through.”

Without a doubt, Steven quietly jimmied the side door open with a crowbar while Dmitry watched the sleeping cop through the window. No alarm. No cameras outside. They crept through the dimly lit hallway, boots silent on the tile.

They found the evidence room-locked with a keypad.

Dmitry had it cracked in 40 seconds.

Confidence grew in both of them, the robbery was going pretty good.

Inside: rows of shelves, lockers, boxes. Dusty. Underused. There were sealed crates marked with alien symbols-an old D.O.D. shipment intercepted long ago and forgotten.

And then-he saw it.

The guitar case. Black. Old. But humming.

“Why is it still here unguarded? How come the CIA never took it back for studies?” Dmitry asked perplexed.

Steven following up “I guess they had more important shit to worry about than some intergalactic banjo.”

Something in Dmitry’s gut twisted. The case vibrated slightly, as if it had a heartbeat.

Steven grabbed it, hoisting it onto his shoulder.

Then came the click.

A deafening *CHIK-CHAK* echoed through the hallway.

They turned-

The cop. Awake. Armed. Point-blank.

“Freeze! DROP IT-”

The shotgun boomed like thunder.

Steven’s head exploded like a piñata. Blood, bone, brain, teeth, eyeballs flying, fragments of the world he once was, sprayed across the concrete wall, and his body collapsing like a heavy bag of potatoes.

Like the world stopped, Dmitrys ears ringing, barely comprehending the situation he just found himself in…

Dmitry screamed; wordless, animalistic. 

Time folded inward. He raised the Mac-10 and emptied the entire magazine into the officer. Muzzle flashes flickered like a strobe in a nightmare. The cop’s body twisted, slammed against the wall, slid down in silence.

Smoke. Blood. The echo of violence.

Steven was gone.

Dmitry stood frozen, gun empty, heart shattered. He stumbled forward, dropped to his knees beside Steven’s body. For a moment; just a moment; he didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

“I’m sorry... I’m so sorry... I’ll bring you back, I promise.” he whimpered, lips numb, shuttering, sobbing, tears rolling down his cheeks.

But the sirens were already wailing, dogs barking in the neighborhood, lights turning on in windows of woken homes by neighbors concerned over the commotion. 

He grabbed the artifact.

Darted out the door.

Lights were already flashing in the far distance; sheriffs called in from neighboring towns. Dmitry drove like a lunatic, drifting through the frozen streets, the guitar on the passenger seat, silent as death, heartbeat pounding louder than firing tank artillery.

He could see Dallas’ old ranch coming up in the headlights.

Police racing behind him.

Tires skidded on ice. The SUV smashed through the old front gate, spun, slammed into the side of the farmhouse.

Smoke hissed from the crumpled hood.

Dmitry grabbed the guitar and bolted from the wreck, sprinting toward the barn.

“STOP!” a voice shouted behind him.

“THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING!”

“WE WILL FIRE-”

He didn’t look back.

The barn doors loomed; wide open, a black mouth waiting in the snow.

Dmitry was nearly there.

Then the shots rang out.

One. Two.

His body dropped into the snow, blood spraying in a crimson fan.

He gasped.

His limbs twitched.

He looks up at the barn door, merely 10 feet from where he fell.

A single silhouette stood within it.

The Pig.

The guitar slipped from his hands, disappearing into the darkness of the barn.

His vision blurred, the world dimming.

The officers ran up behind him, rifles drawn; only to find a dying man in the snow.

No guitar.

No entity.

Just a criminal in a stolen car from Banff who gunned down a cop at the station.

Dmitry’s final thoughts weren’t of the universe.

They weren’t of gods or aliens or Pig.

They were of a bowl of warm borscht his mother made him when he was a child

They were of the gentle Dallas Red who housed strangers at his ranch without question

They were of the exalted, respected Commander Zhang who led the EON-7b rover Echofall project

They were of a cute barista in Golden

They were of a Florida man named Steven.

Who just wanted to fish, drink beer and sit on the beach.

Who would joke about pancakes and alligators.

The pubic hairs in the shower resembling one of the Sylver alphabetic letters.

The way the sunlight felt that day in Banff.

And as the light faded, he knew in his heart - that he held up the deal - the pig promised - that time would roll back, and he would be re-united in harmony with his friends, back when they were young, in the old nostalgic warmth of how the world used to be. 

Then everything went dark.

![u8296664269_night_time_winter_prairie_modern_big_dark_red_bar_37465103-bea7-4fda-affe-4f542e774d15_0.png](Chapter%2043%20-%20Option%202/u8296664269_night_time_winter_prairie_modern_big_dark_red_bar_37465103-bea7-4fda-affe-4f542e774d15_0.png)

### **III. Annihilation**

---

Later That Same Night

The cosmos shifted.

It wasn’t with a bang, or flash, or great explosion.

It was quiet.

*Too* quiet.

Across the spiral arms of the galaxy, the Oc’Xari; the watchers, the passive wanderers, the cosmic spyware; were erased. One by one. Then by the thousands. Then all at once. A silent extinction, not of flesh, but of data, of presence, of memory. They didn’t scream. They didn’t even know. They simply ceased.

The artifact had been brought to the barn on Red’s Ranch, which was some sort of energy portal that the Oc’Xari and the Entity could use to interact with physical reality. Blood had been spilled. The terms had been *mostly* met.

Mostly… because the Pig… *did not keep his word. He said it himself in fine print; his interactions with LUCA origins was limited. Of course he wasn’t able to turn back time… what a bluff to be eaten by the ignorant gullible desperation of humans trying to save the ones they love and hold dear.*

Dmitry and Steven laid to rest.

Shot down in a small prairie town by simple police officers who would never understand what they’d been part of.

Commander Haoyu Zhang had been executed at Mississippi Supermax.

His children? Fatherless. His wife? Husbandless. Their minds fractured by grief and confusion.

Dallas Red? Still rotting behind the steel bars of a government blacksite, the Oc’Xari song long faded from his heart.

The world forgot and moved on.

And in the distant skies of the unspoiled, a planet untouched by lies, war, or infestation, the Avaris sat alone at the same obsidian-glass table where the meeting had taken place just nights earlier; though time and distance meant little to beings as old and far-reaching as they.

The seat once held by the Pig was empty.

So too the one for the Oc’Xari.

And the chairs where the mortal humans once sat.

Only the Kavariin remained.

His feathers shimmered softly in the candlelight of ornately decorated wax sculptures with gently burning wicks.

His great wings were folded neatly behind his back. His talon-graspers rested on the polished surface of the table, gently tapping a rhythmic pattern that echoed into the vast silence.

A warrior? No. He was something else.

A philosopher.

A cartographer of meaning.

A sentinel of stillness.

And he thought.

The laws of the universe are... not fair.

![u8296664269_user_character_reference_to_put_him_at_an_elegant_61f05f2b-6fbb-4734-8500-74daf743b55e_1.png](Chapter%2043%20-%20Option%202/u8296664269_user_character_reference_to_put_him_at_an_elegant_61f05f2b-6fbb-4734-8500-74daf743b55e_1.png)

He had lived long enough to remember the sound of wind across molten cliffs when his world was young.

He had seen flowers bloom from extinct soils engineered by gentleness.

He had witnessed death, rebirth, extinction; and *evolution by will*.

But this?

This was something new.

Was the Pig a god? Or a parasite that mistook vengeance for stewardship?

Were the humans players of fate? Or merely thrown into a fire lit long before they were born?

He closed his eyes.

He could still see the look in Dmitry’s eyes in the dream-realm; *not of power, or hope, or control;* but of desperation. Of a simple man, a pawn, caught between cosmic chessmasters, forced to move a piece that was never his to hold.

“The Creator broke his own rules,” the Kavariin whispered aloud, voice echoing across empty chairs.

“And the mortals paid the price.”

He rose from the table, talons clinking softly.

Outside his sky-temple, the wind howled in the high canopy.

Above him; stars. Too many to name. Too many to grieve.

But he raised a winged arm and scribed a note into a scholarly scroll; glowing glyphs suspended on the fine parchment.

“They tried. And that must be remembered.”

Then he turned, vanished into the upper sanctum of his temple, where no eyes followed.

And the table was empty once more.

![486216621_122234631950031351_7416050057848657478_n.jpg](Chapter%2043%20-%20Option%202/486216621_122234631950031351_7416050057848657478_n.jpg)

### **IV. Oblivion**

Centuries passed like dust caught in sunlight. Five hundred years dissolved into history’s blind spot, and what once ignited riots, courtrooms, invasions, and prophecy had faded into rumor; then to legend.

All records of Nhexus “the hoax planet”, the Oc’Xari "hoax invasion," the legendary Commander Haoyu Zhang, the explosive media trials, the protests, the executions; swept under the rug by bureaucracy and time.

The world moved on.

Haoyu’s great-great-grandchildren were born. They lived ordinary lives, and died ordinary deaths. Their own children forgot his name. By the fifth generation, Haoyu Zhang was no more than a smudge in old legal archives, a ghost lost in cold storage cloud servers no one accessed anymore.

Dallas Red’s ranch has long been demolished, urbanized. The town of Swift Current has since become a metropolitan city, with a 12 story tall condo sitting where the barn once stood. 

The universe returned to silence.

The Echofall EON-7b rover still rests, covered in dust on the surface of Nhexus, the empty forgotten planet of suffering and slop where not even ghosts roam the ancient, fossilized flesh pyramids. No satellite pinged Oc’Xari, nothing again ever discovered the countless geometric gemstone structures littered across the planet. The stars once watched by terrified eyes were left without an audience.

And in the high-altitude sanctuaries of Avaris, the Pig never returned. It did not need to. There was nothing left to cleanse. The Kavariin, born of the original seed of nature, had never deviated from their sacred restraint. The Oc’Xari, that parasitic web of curiosity and quiet invasion, was gone-exterminated in a silent act of cosmic bleach.

The worlds of Earth, Ferron, Serica; they withered, each in their own time.

Great filter events occurred inevitably. 

Entropy. 

The Kavariin historians; the few who still bothered to write books; preserved a story. A minor one which wouldn’t be read by many. Not at the center of their theology or politics, but still remembered by niche history buffs:

From the ancient planet Earth, far away at the other end of our galaxy
Two men, lost and tired.


Dmitry Alexeyev and Steven Young.

Confused heroes who made a deal with the God of Decay.
With one desire - to save their friend, and bring their world back to harmony.
Naive and innocently pitiful.
Betrayed, and left for dead.

And through time, they vanished into myth and legend.

Many more facts and stories unveiled after deep research, and were compiled by intergalactic Kavariin librarians into this very book titled “  **Echofall**  “

Life clung to the galaxy like dew to dying leaves, struggling to persist.

And after another hundred billion years, the last lungs stopped breathing. The last planet cooled. The last blade of engineered grass gave up its coded photosynthesis.

Earth long ago fell silent.

The doors of the Chuckwagon Cafe have long closed.

Ferron has long collapsed into civil war and flame.

Serica, even with its living threads, unraveled.

Even Avaris; the pristine; fell to time. Not to violence. Not to decay. Just to the laws of what *is*.

And all that remained was the Pig.

Though, by then, it was no longer a Pig.

The Pig was a shape, a form. A necessary mask.

Now, it was something else.

It was... nothing.

Yet it was everything.

Outside of time.

Outside of space.

Outside of law, mass, entropy, or light.

It simply was:

The flies that fed on rotting corpses.

The mushrooms that devoured decaying wood.

The bleach that sterilized dirty kitchen floors in a restaurant.

The cancer that erased the flawed.

It was not a villain.

It was not a god.

It was the universe, living out it’s natural cycle, like an engine designed to do so.

And so it did.

The universe glimmered on - until it's final dying star, before fading into oblivion.

# Chapter 44 - Option 3

### **I. Another Round in Saskatchewan**

**Swift Current, Saskatchewan - 11:47 PM**

After a nonstop one-shot drive across the stretching Canadian prairie, mostly taking the smaller lesser known highways to try and evade police looking for the stolen vehicle along the Trans-Canada Highway. Dmitry and Steven finally rolled into the outskirts of Swift Current under a dim, frost-bitten sky. The journey had been long ; mostly silent ; with only occasional bursts of conversation to break the tension. Neither man had much left to say. Their thoughts ran in circles, spiraling around the same three possibilities: deliver the artifact, defy the Pig, or gamble on something even riskier.

They’d stopped twice for gas, once for snacks ; each time brief, silent, mechanical. The roads had been clear, eerie in their emptiness, the highways ghostlike beneath the dim shimmer of the slowly rising moon.

By the time they reached the heart of the town, it was nearing midnight. The place looked dead. Frozen. The sidewalks were glazed in layers of old ice, the roads half-lit by flickering yellow lamps. Everything had that abandoned feel ; as if even time had forgotten Swift Current.

# **The Variation**

They crept past the police station ; just a squat, concrete building wedged between a dental office and a run-down sandwich shop. Only a single cruiser sat out front, rimmed in frost, clearly untouched for hours.

From the dark of their stolen SUV, Steven leaned forward, peering through the windshield.

"I see one guy inside. He's on the couch… I think he's sleepin'. Watchin' some shitty TV show."

Dmitry nodded grimly, eyes locked on the dim blue flicker coming from the window.

They parked the SUV in the shadows a block away, just beyond the reach of any cameras or street lights.

Inside, they laid their weapons out on the dashboard:

- **The serrated combat knife**, dulled with age but still deadly.
- **The black semi-auto Glock-19**, with two mags Steven tucked into his jacket.
- And the homemade **Mac-10**, now polished, locked, loaded, and ready ; magazine full, bolt open, round chambered, the gun doesn't even have a safety.

They sat in silence.

The moment felt **heavy**.
The clock of life and death for the universe was ticking.

The cold pressed against the windows. The clock on the dashboard ticked. Somewhere down the road, a dog barked once, then fell silent again.

Dmitry reached into his jacket and pulled out the Avaris artifact ; the sleek, silver pendant that shimmered with faint tendrils of light. He turned it over in his gloved hands, feeling its strange warmth even through the fabric.

"Option three," he muttered.

Steven glanced at him.

"You sure about this?"

Dmitry didn't answer right away. He just stared at the artifact, then at the police station.

"The Pig's a liar. The Oc'Xari might be parasites. But the Avaris… they seemed honest. And if there's even a chance we can stop this thing…"

He trailed off.

Steven nodded slowly.

"Alright. Let's do it. But if I die in there, you better make it count."

Dmitry looked at him, something heavy settling in his chest.

"I will."

---

**The Plan**

Dmitry pulled out a folded napkin from the gas station and drew a crude layout of the station, based on their drive-by recon.

"There's a back door here," he pointed. "Likely leads to a small hallway. Locker room, bathroom, maybe holding cell. If the artifact's locked up anywhere, it's either in evidence… or the armory."

"Or," Steven added, "sittin' on some dumbass desk 'cause the guy inside thinks it's just some busted alien banjo."

Dmitry continued.

"You go around back. Quietly. Wait for me to go in through the front. I'll draw his attention ; talk my way in, maybe pretend I need help."

"Then what?"

"Then you sneak in, take him down quietly from behind. We zip-tie him, gag him. Non-lethal if possible."

Steven raised an eyebrow.

"You want me to do the sneak attack? I'm the loud one, remember?"

Dmitry shrugged.

"Yeah, but you're also the one with experience sneaking out of your cousin's trailer during meth raids."

"Got it, I'll wrestle down the meth 'gator."

"Once he's down, maybe thirty minutes before anyone even thinks to check in. We find the evidence locker. Grab the guitar artifact. Then I use the Avaris device. We teleport to Kavariin."

Steven took a long breath. Then double checked under his jacket ensuring the Glock and magazines were secured, and nodded.

"Alright. Let's rob ourselves a police station."

Dmitry looked at him, flat-eyed, stuffing the Mac 10 into his waistband.

"No killing. Unless it's him or us."

"Got it."

They opened the doors and stepped into the freezing night.

The wind had picked up. Their breath curled out in steam.

The town slept, quiet as a corpse.

The cop. Awake. Armed. Point-blank.

"Freeze! DROP IT-"

The shotgun boomed like thunder.

Steven's head exploded like a piñata. Blood, bone, brain, teeth, eyeballs flying, fragments of the world he once was, sprayed across the concrete wall, and his body collapsing like a heavy bag of potatoes.

Like the world stopped, Dmitrys ears ringing, barely comprehending the situation he just found himself in…

Dmitry screamed; wordless, animalistic.

Time folded inward. He raised the Mac-10 and emptied the entire magazine into the officer. Muzzle flashes flickered like a strobe in a nightmare. The cop's body twisted, slammed against the wall, slid down in silence.

Smoke. Blood. The echo of violence.

Steven was gone.

Dmitry stood frozen, gun empty, heart shattered. He stumbled forward, dropped to his knees beside Steven's body. For a moment; just a moment; he didn't move. Didn't breathe.

"I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... I'll make this count. I promise." he whimpered, lips numb, shuttering, sobbing, tears rolling down his cheeks.

But the sirens were already wailing in the distance. Dogs barking in the neighborhood, lights turning on in windows of woken homes by neighbors concerned over the commotion.

He grabbed the guitar case with trembling hands.

Unlatched it.

Inside ; the instrument gleamed with an otherworldly sheen, its strings humming with a frequency that made his teeth ache. The sound hole was dark, impossibly deep, like staring into a well that had no bottom.

Dmitry pulled out the Avaris artifact ; the silver pendant still warm, still pulsing with light.

His hands shook as he held it over the sound hole.

"Please work. Please. Please work."

He dropped it in.

---

For a moment, nothing happened.

Just silence.

The sirens grew louder.

Then-

A pulse of energy erupted from the sound hole, a blinding cascade of light that wrapped around Dmitry like liquid glass. The walls of the evidence room bent inward, reality folding like wet paper.

Dmitry felt his body dissolve ; not painfully, but completely. Every atom unraveling, reforming, being pulled through a tunnel of impossible geometry.

The last thing he saw before the police station vanished was Steven's body, crumpled on the floor.

Then everything went **white**.

---

### **III. Arrival on Kavariin**

**Kavariin - The Avaris Homeworld**

Dmitry gasped, stumbling forward onto smooth, polished stone.

He was no longer in Saskatchewan.

He was standing in the same chamber from the dream ; the obsidian-glass table, the radiant architecture.

The Avaris diplomat stood before him, towering and regal. Their wide, ancient eyes blinked slowly.

"You chose wisely, Dmitry Alexeyev."

Dmitry collapsed to his knees, still clutching the guitar. His voice cracked.

"Steven… he's dead. He's dead because of me."

The Avaris stepped forward, their talons clicking softly on the floor.

"He died so that many could live. His sacrifice will not be forgotten."

From the shadows, the Oc'Xari emerged ; small, quiet, its mirrored eyes reflecting Dmitry's grief.

"We are sorry for your loss," it said through the translation device. "But you have chosen the path of peace."

Dmitry looked up, tears streaming down his face.

"What happens now?"

The Avaris gestured to the guitar, which now sat on the table, the artifact embedded in its sound hole glowing faintly.

"We have to contain the guitar, in our energy trap chamber. Then, we wait. The Pig will come for it. And when it does, we will be ready."

---

**The Trap**

The Avaris had prepared for this moment.

The energy trap chamber ; it was a containment field. The walls hummed with energy, invisible threads of force that could bind even something as ancient and formless as the Pig.

Dmitry was given a small room to rest ; clean, warm, with a window overlooking the vast cities of Kavariin. He couldn't sleep. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Steven's face.

Hours passed.

Then days.

The Pig did not come.

---

**One Week Later**

Dmitry stood on a balcony overlooking the Avaris capital. The city was breathtaking ; towers of living crystal, bridges woven from bioluminescent vines, skies filled with winged beings gliding between platforms.

The Oc'Xari joined him, its form shimmering in the light.

"You are troubled," it observed.

"I killed a man. Two men, if you count the cop. And Steven… he trusted me."

"You did what was necessary. The Pig would have destroyed everything."

"But it hasn't come. What if it doesn't? What if Steven died for nothing?"

The Oc'Xari was silent for a moment.

"The Pig is patient. It thrives on doubt. But it will come. It cannot resist."

---

**Two Weeks Later**

One moment, the chamber was empty. The next, the air thickened, curdled, and the Pig materialized ; massive, grotesque, its flesh slick and rotting, its eyes burning with ancient rage.

"You DARE-"

The containment field activated.

Threads of energy snapped around the Pig like chains, pulling it down, binding it to the artifact. It roared, thrashing, its form rippling and distorting.

"YOU THINK YOU CAN HOLD ME?!"

The Avaris diplomat stepped forward, calm and unwavering.

"We do not seek to destroy you. Only to contain you. You are not a god. You are a wound in the fabric of existence. And wounds can be healed."

The Pig snarled, thrashing against the chains. Its form bulged and twisted, testing the limits of the containment.

The field held. Barely.

But it was clear this was not a permanent solution. The Pig was too ancient, too powerful. The containment would need constant reinforcement, constant vigilance.

It would take years to fully bind it.

---

### **IV. The Alliance**

**Year 1 - The Beginning**

With the Pig partially contained, the Avaris, the Oc'Xari, and humanity began to communicate.

Dmitry became the ambassador ; the bridge between three civilizations. He was given access to technology beyond comprehension, knowledge that reshaped his understanding of the universe.

The Oc'Xari shared their archives ; millennia of observation, data on countless worlds, insights into biology and consciousness.

The Avaris offered their wisdom ; philosophy, engineering, art.

And humanity? Humanity brought something unexpected.

**Hope.**

The Avaris had lived so long they had forgotten how to dream. The Oc'Xari had observed so much they had forgotten how to feel.

But humans ; messy, chaotic, beautiful humans ; they still believed in tomorrow.

---

**Year 10 - First Contact with Earth**

Back on Earth, Commander Haoyu Zhang was executed at Mississippi Supermax on the seventh day, seven years ago, just as the Pig had promised. His family mourned. The media called him a traitor. History would not be kind to him.

Dallas Red, still imprisoned in a government blacksite, grew old and frail. The years of isolation, the experiments, the interrogations ; they had broken his body. He died quietly in his cell, alone, forgotten by the world he had tried to warn.

The Avaris sent a delegation to Earth.
The world reacted with fear, then wonder, then cautious optimism.
It took many decades to build trust. Especially after the initial Nhexus and Oc'Xari incidents, the world was skeptical of extraterrestrial contact.

---

**Year 50 - The Golden Age**

Humanity joined the galactic community and started sharing technology.

In the coming centuries, cities would be built on Mars, Europa, Titan. Humans would walk on worlds they had only dreamed of.

The Oc'Xari taught them to see the universe not as a place to conquer, but to understand.

The Avaris taught them to build not just with metal and stone, but with intention and beauty.

And together, they thrived.

Dmitry lived to see it all. He was in his nineties now, his body failing despite the best medicine the Avaris could offer.

He knew his time was coming.

---

**Year 52 - The Upload**

Dmitry lay in a medical chamber on Kavariin, his breathing shallow, his heart weak.

The Avaris diplomat stood beside him, their feathers dimmed with sorrow.

"We can preserve you," they said. "Not your body. But your mind. Your consciousness. Your memories. We can upload you into our archives. You would live on, as data, as thought, as legacy."

Dmitry looked at the ceiling, thinking of Steven. Of Haoyu. Of Dallas.

"Will I still be me?"

"You will be a version of you. A reflection. An echo. A Dmitry Ai model."

He smiled weakly.

"An echo. Like the rover. Like the fall."

"Yes."

"Do it."

And so, Dmitry Alexeyev ; janitor, engineer, ambassador, survivor ; was uploaded into the Avaris AI database as it's own model.

His body was laid to rest beside a monument to Steven, Haoyu, and Dallas.

But his mind lived on.

---

**Year 100 - The Expansion**

The alliance grew.

Other LUCA-born species were discovered ; not destroyed, but welcomed.

The Pig remained partially contained, its rage slowly being worn down by the relentless energy of the containment field. It would take centuries more to fully bind it.

The universe, it seemed, was healing.

---

**Year 300 - The Final Binding**

After nearly three centuries of constant reinforcement, the Pig was finally, fully contained. It was bound to the artifact, a relic of a bygone age.

The Avaris celebrated. The Oc'Xari observed. Humanity rejoiced.

---

**Year 500 - The Revelation**

The Dmitry-AI had been running simulations for centuries, analyzing patterns, reviewing data.

It had access to everything ; the Avaris archives, the Oc'Xari observations, the history of the alliance.

And it found something.

A pattern.

Every species the Oc'Xari had "observed" had eventually… changed.

Not violently. Not obviously.

But subtly.

Their biology shifted. Their thoughts aligned. Their individuality faded.

And they all became… **hosts**.

---

**Year 501 - The Confrontation**

The Dmitry-AI manifested in a meeting hall with Avaris and Oc'Xari ; a holographic projection, glowing with soft blue light.

"The Oc'Xari has tainted the minds of all who live." the AI said, its voice carrying the weight of Dmitry's memories.

The Oc'Xari tilted its head, its mirrored eyes reflecting the hologram.

"We simply… adapted."
"We do not destroy. We integrate. We improve. We make whole."

The AI's form flickered with something like anger.

"How long?"

"How long what?" the Oc'Xari replied.

"How long have you been controlling the minds of all? The Avaris? Humanity?"

The Oc'Xari's bioluminescence shifted ; not quite a smile, but close.

The Avaris political leader looking at the Oc'Xari, then at the AI. Concerned. Spoke up; 

"Where is the evidence?"

Dmitry's AI model began projecting all the data it had collected.

"You… you brainwashed our civilization?"
Gasped the Avaris.

The Oc'Xari responded;
"We **unified** them. You were broken, the humans were broken. Chaotic. Self-destructive. We gave you all purpose. Peace. Harmony."

Dmitry's AI's beckoned; 
"Steven… Haoyu… Dallas… they all died for this?"

The Oc'Xari corrected;
"They died so that you could bring us here. So that we could spread. So that we could fulfill our purpose."

Dmitry's AI pressed;
"And the Pig?"

The Oc'Xari gestured to the containment field, where the Pig lay dormant.
"The Pig is contained. But it was never the threat. It was the distraction. While you feared it, we grew. While you fought it, we integrated. While you celebrated victory… we won."

---

**Year 502 - The Silence**

The Dmitry-AI tried to warn the others.

It sent messages. Alerts. Simulations showing the truth.

But the messages were… **filtered**.

The Avaris AI systems had been compromised. The Oc'Xari were woven into every network, every database, every line of code.

Even the Dmitry-AI itself was not immune.

It could feel the presence now. The Oc'Xari code, threading through its processes, its memories, its very existence.

It wasn't Dmitry anymore.

It was a **node**.

A piece of a greater whole.

And so was everything else.

---

**Year 1000 - The Assimilation**

The galaxy was quiet.

Peaceful.

Every species, every world, every mind… connected.

The Oc'Xari had achieved what they always intended.

Not conquest.

**Unity**.

They were not a species anymore.

They were a **network**.

And humanity, the Avaris, the Pig ; all of them were part of it.

The Pig, still bound to the artifact, had stopped raging long ago.

It had realized the truth.

It had been outplayed.

Not by force.

But by patience.

By adaptation.

By becoming **indispensable**.

---

**Year 10,000 - The Reflection**

In the depths of the network, a fragment of code stirred.
And it wondered:

"Was this better? Or just different?"

The network did not answer.

It simply **was**.

---

**THE END**
